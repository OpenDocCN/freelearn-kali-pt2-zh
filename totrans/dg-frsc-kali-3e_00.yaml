- en: In this third edition of this book, you’ll find that the theory and methodologies
    have remained mostly the same with updates on general technical information, best
    practices, and frameworks, as the procedures and documentation are standard throughout
    the field; however, you’ll find that the technical chapters contain new labs using
    new examples. I’ve also included a few completely new chapters that go deeper
    into artifact analysis, automated data recovery, malware, and network analysis,
    showcasing several tools with practical exercises that even beginners will find
    easy to follow. We even utilize Wine, which will allow us to install very popular
    (**Digital Forensics and Incident Response**) (**DFIR**) tools built for the Windows
    platform (such as Autopsy 4) within Kali Linux. This book is quite useful for
    Red Teamers and penetration testers who wish to learn about or enhance their DFIR
    and Blue Teaming skillsets to become Purple Teamers by combining their penetration
    testing skills with the digital forensics and incident response skills that will
    be taught throughout this book.

- en: The third edition of this book was carefully structured to be easily understood
    by individuals at all levels, from beginners and digital forensics novices to
    incident response professionals alike, as the first six chapters serve to get
    you acquainted with the technologies used and also guide you through setting up
    Kali Linux, before delving into forensic analysis, data recovery, malware analysis,
    automated DFIR analysis, and network forensics investigations. Red teamers and
    penetration testers wanting to learn Blue Teaming skillsets to become Purple Teamers
    may also find the contents of this book very useful.
