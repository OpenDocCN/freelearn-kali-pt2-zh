- en: We set up our Honeypot using FreeRADIUS-WPE. The enterprise client is misconfigured
    to not use certificate validation with PEAP. This allows us to present our own
    fake certificate to the client, which it gladly accepts. Once this happens, MSCHAP-v2,
    the inner authentication protocol, kicks in. As the client uses our fake certificate
    to encrypt the data, we are easily able to recover the username, challenge, and
    response tuples.

    enabled, if the administrator does not mention the authentic servers in connect
    to these servers list, the attacker can obtain a real certificate for another
    domain from any of the listed certifying authorities. This will still be accepted
    by the client. Other variations of this attack are possible as well.
