    forensics and its proper practices and procedures. At some point, you may have
    come across several books, blogs, and even videos demonstrating various aspects
    of digital forensics and the different tools used. It is of great importance to
    understand that forensics itself is a science involving very well-documented best
    practices and methods to reveal whether something exists or does not.

    may have read or noticed that there was a substantial increase in cyberattacks.
    A major contributing factor to these attacks will have been the lack of awareness
    training by employees at all levels who may have fallen victim to phishing attacks.
    There were numerous phishing campaigns during the lockdown period, which tricked
    and social-engineered users into either opening malicious emails or divulging
    personal or corporate information. This was done by threat actors using email
    subjects relating to Covid-19 outbreaks, health updates, and even through requests
    for help from the compromised (hacked) email accounts of friends and family who
    may have appeared to be stranded in countries under lockdown and were asking for
    financial assistance to get back home.

    attacks from notorious ransomware and **Advanced Persistence Threat** (**APT**)
    groups, with ransomware being readily available for purchase on the dark web.
    ALPHV, Darkside, Revil, and BlackCat are just some of the most notorious ransomware
    and APT groups whose names generally strike fear into the hearts of any cybersecurity
    professional. These groups are known to compromise individuals and companies and
    then request that a ransom be paid, ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.
    Not only is data highly encrypted and lost, but many of these groups now attack
    the victims using DDoS attacks and also release exfiltrated data belonging to
    the victim on dark web blogs. We’ll delve a bit more into ransomware later on
    in the book.

    formal procedures to adhere to, but if we don’t have the right mechanisms in place
    to even detect the incident, then we may be far worse off than initially thought.
    This is where the need for blue and purple teamers arises. Hackers, malware developers,
    APTs, and the like do not take time off and certainly do not care about the financial
    state of companies and economies. Ransomware has, in the past, proven to be very
    profitable in some cases, and it must be considered that at any given day or time,
    malware developers are working on new methods of compromise.

    or at least outsource the talent and functions of a team if deciding against having
    one in-house. There are many **Managed Security Services** (**MSS**) companies
    out there that can perform all necessary monitoring and alerting systems. However,
    a company with one or two well-trained blue and/or purple teamers will always
    have the advantage where preparedness and response are concerned, as in-house
    teams tend to have the advantage of not just knowing the technical details of
    the company but also having an understanding of the organizational culture and
    the level of (and sometimes lack of) awareness of the staff and general human
    resources, which more often than not, may prove to be the weakest link within
    the organization as far as cybersecurity is concerned.

- en: Having blue teamers conduct periodic cybersecurity awareness training is just
    as important as patching critical infrastructure devices, such as firewalls, routers,
    switches, and servers. Cybersecurity awareness is now something that must be considered
    just as much as physical safety awareness, as one small mistake could potentially
    bring an entire conglomerate to its knees and cost the organization millions of
    dollars. It helps a great deal if employees are aware of the general cybersecurity
    threats to the organization and themselves, and more so if they are made aware
    of specific threats to their organization and sector and educated on specific
    threat instances that may have occurred in the organization. This way, the blue
    teamers can create a cybersecurity awareness culture, where persons are more alert
    and understand the risks and impact of individual actions as far as the security
    of the organization and its data and assets are concerned.

- en: Keeping in mind that forensics is a science, digital forensics requires that
    you follow appropriate best practices and procedures in an effort to produce the
    same results time and time again, providing proof of evidence, preservation, and
    integrity, which can be replicated if called upon to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although many individuals may not be performing digital forensics to be used
    as evidence in a court of law, it is best to practice DFIR in such a way as it
    can be accepted and presented in a court of law. The main purpose of adhering
    to best practices set by organizations specializing in digital forensics and incident
    response is to maintain the integrity of the evidence for the duration of the
    investigation. In the event that the investigator’s work must be scrutinized and
    critiqued by another or an opposing party, the results found by the investigator
    must be able to be recreated, thereby proving the integrity of the investigation.
    The purpose of this is to ensure that your methods can be repeated and, if dissected
    or scrutinized, produce the same results time and again. The methodology used,
    including the procedures and findings of your investigation, should always allow
    for the maintenance of the data’s integrity, regardless of what tools are used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best practices demonstrated in this book ensure that the original evidence
    is not tampered with, or in cases of investigating devices and data in a live
    or production environment, show well-documented proof that the necessary steps
    were taken during the investigation to avoid unnecessary tampering with the evidence,
    thereby preserving the integrity of the evidence. For those completely new to
    investigations, I recommend familiarizing yourself with some of the various practices
    and methodologies available and widely practiced by the professional community.

    replicated using different tools. This is especially useful in instances where
    the investigator’s work may be critiqued, and the integrity of the case and evidence
    questioned and scrutinized; using multiple tools correctly will yield consistent
    results. Let’s now look at why we may need to use more than one tool in investigations

    of us may have a large budget to work with, while others may have a limited one
    or none at all. Commercial tools can be costly, especially due to research and

    Both social media and underground communication channels soon became the easiest
    forms of communication between like-minded hackers and hacktivists. With the internet
    and World Wide Web becoming easily accessible, this also saw competition not only
    between IPs but also private companies and corporations, which led to the creation
    of free wireless hotspots on almost every street with businesses, small or large.

    anyone with a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or other devices to acquire almost unauthenticated
    access to the internet. This gave them access to hacker sites and portals, along
    with the ability to download tools, upload malware, send infected emails, or even
    carry out attacks.

    in the masking of **Publicly Identifiable Information** (**PII**), or any information
    that would aid in the discovery of unveiling suspects involved in cyber-crimes
    during forensic investigations. Tools used for the encryption of data and anonymity,
    such as masking of IP addresses, are readily available to anyone, most of which
    are increasingly more and more user-friendly.

    as these can be easily set up to intercept personal data, such as login and password
    information, together with PII (such as social security numbers, date of birth
    info, and phone numbers) from any user that may connect to the Wi-Fi and enter
    such information.

    and uses technology in very much the same way we use locks and keys to safeguard
    our personal and private belongings. For a lock to open, there must be a specific
    matching key. So too, in the digital world, data is encrypted or locked using
    an encryption algorithm and must use the same key to decrypt or unlock the data.
    There also exists another scenario where one key may be used to encrypt or lock
    the data and another used to decrypt the data. Two very popular encryption tools
    are **TrueCrypt** and **VeraCrypt**.

    confidential. The main barrier to forensics may be acquiring the decryption key
    to decrypt or unlock access to the data.

    is also the concept of anonymity, which adds to the complexity of maintaining
    the accuracy of the true sources found in investigations. Like encryption, there
    exist several free and open source tools for all OS platforms, such as Windows,
    MacOS, Linux, and Android, which attempt to (most often successfully) mask the
    hiding of someone’s digital footprint. This digital footprint usually identifies
    a device by its IP and **Media Access Control** (**MAC**) address. Without going
    into the network aspect of things, these two digital addresses can be compared
    to a person’s full name and home address, respectively.

    (home and work) and public network (internet) access, the MAC address remains
    the same.

- en: However, various tools are also freely available to spoof or fake your IP and
    MAC addresses for the purpose of privacy and anonymity. Adding to that, users
    can use a system of routing their data through online servers and devices to make
    tracing the sources of the sent data quite difficult. This system is referred
    to as **proxy chaining** and does keep some of the user’s identity hidden.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good example of this would be **Tor Browser**; it uses onion routing and several
    proxies worldwide to route or pass the data along from proxy to proxy, making
    the tracing of the source very difficult but not impossible. You can think of
    proxy chains as a relay race, but instead of having four people, one passing the
    baton to the next, the data is passed between hundreds of proxy devices worldwide.

    science has been around for a very long time, as far back as the early 1900s.
    Although digital forensics may have only been on the scene since the early 2000s,
    as a science, we have certain best practices, procedures, standards, and frameworks,
    such as those created by the ACPO, SWGDE, and NIST, to adhere to. These maintain
    the accuracy and the integrity of both the findings and the actual evidence when
    carrying out investigations, whether as an amateur or professional digital forensic
    investigator.

    Forensics. Many of the open source tools available are made for Linux-based distributions
    and can be downloaded individually, but many are readily available within certain
    forensic and security OSs or distributions. Some of these distros are DEFT Linux,
    CAINE, CSI Linux, and of course, Kali Linux; all of these are freely available
    for download at the links provided.
