    automatically generated](../media/file0.png)Cybersecurity is one of the most exciting
    and rapidly growing fields in the world. Each day, security professionals and
    researchers are discovering new and emerging threats at an increasing rate, and
    many organizations are discovering their systems and networks are compromised
    by malicious actors, while there are so many companies without proper cyber defenses
    to detected threats and determine whether their assets are compromised or not.
    Due to the increase in cyber-attacks and threats around the world, there are more
    cybersecurity-related jobs are being created within many organizations who seeks
    to acquire industry experts and skilled professionals who can help improve their
    cyber defenses and safeguard their assets from cyber criminals. This book is designed
    with the intention to provide you with the skills, knowledge, and wisdom that
    are needed by aspiring ethical hackers and penetration testers for the cybersecurity
    industry. During the course of this book, you will develop new skills and learn
    techniques on simulating real-world cyber-attacks on systems and networks as a
    cybersecurity professional with the intent to discovery hidden security vulnerabilities
    within organizations, while understanding the **Tactics, Techniques and Procedures**
    (**TTPs**) used by real attackers to compromise their targets. In addition, you
    will learn how to leverage one of the most popular Linux distributions within
    the cybersecurity industry, *Kali Linux* to perform ethical hacking and penetration
    testing assessments on targeted systems and network infrastructure. The Kali Linux
    operation system has tons of pre-installed Linux packages (applications) and security
    tools that are commonly used by industry experts, hence it’s an arsenal packed
    with everything you’ll need as an ethical hacker and penetration tester. Throughout
    this book, we’ll be using a student-centric and learner-friendly approach, filled
    with a lot of practical and hands-on exercises to help you to gradually start
    from beginner-friendly to intermediate, and to advanced topics.In this chapter,
    you will learn about various types of threat actors, and their intentions/motives
    behind their attacks on targets. Furthermore, you will discover how various key
    factors play an important role to attackers when planning a cyber-attack, and
    how such factors determine the level of complexity to compromise a targeted system,
    network or organization as compared to cybersecurity professionals such as ethical
    hackers and penetration testers who are hired to discover hidden vulnerabilities
    within a company. Furthermore, you will learn about the various phases in ethical
    hacking, and penetration testing approaches which are commonly used by industry
    professionals. Lastly, you will gain a solid understanding on how the **Cyber
    Kill Chain** framework is used to help cybersecurity professionals to better understand
    cyber-attacks, and how each phase can be aligned with penetration testing techniques.
    In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:'

    specialized attacks and threats that are designed by cyber criminals with the
    intention to cause harm or damages, these cyber criminals are commonly referred
    to as **threat actors**. As time continues, more users and organizations are connecting
    their systems and networks to the largest network in the world, the internet,
    and cyber criminals are developing new strategies to steal money from potential
    victims. For instance, many cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated
    threats such as ransomware, which is a type of crypto-malware that’s designed
    to encrypt all data found on a victim’s system, except the host operating system.
    The intention is to encrypt the victim’s most valuable asset on the compromised
    system, the data stored on local storage media, and request a ransom payment in
    the form of cryptocurrencies to obtain the decryption keys to recover the data.The
    longer the ransomware is on a compromised system, the ransomware agent would establish
    a **Command and Control** (**C2**) communication channel with either one or more
    C2 servers that are owned and managed by the cyber criminals to receive updates
    and additional instructions. The threat actor can push updates to the ransomware
    agent to frequently update the cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt the
    victim’s data. Therefore, reducing the likelihood the victim is able to safely
    recover their data from the ransomware. During this time, the threat actor is
    also exfiltrating the data found on the victim’s system and selling it on various
    marketplaces on the *Dark Web* to the highest bidder. Cyber criminals are intelligent,
    they are very aware that organizations knows the value of data that are stored
    on their computers and servers, and will do almost anything to recover their data
    as soon as possible.

    cloud storage that is linked to the infected system. For instance, imagine a user's
    system has a cloud storage agent running to ensure the user’s data is constant
    synchronized. If the system is infected with a ransomware, the infection will
    encrypt all data on the local storage drives, including those that are synchronized
    to the cloud service provider platform. However, various cloud storage providers
    have built-in protection against these types of threats.

    there’s no guarantee or reassurance the threat actors will release the encrypted
    data or even provide the right decryption key to recover your data. For instance,
    there are many organizations around the world with a reactive approach to cybersecurity,
    such that, they will only react to when their systems and network are compromised
    to a cyber-attack rather than implementing mitigation and countermeasures to prevent
    future threats. However, if an organization does not implement proper cyber defenses
    with an effective incident response plan, when a ransomware compromises a vulnerable
    system within a network, it has the potential to automatically spread to other
    vulnerable systems within the organization to expand its foothold. Therefore,
    the longer it takes to contain/isolate the threat on the network, the more damages
    can be done.

    many organizations and users are left unprotected from various types of threats.
    For instance, many banks provide an online banking system which enables their
    customers to perform various types of transactions such as making payments, transferring
    funds, and so on. Imagine, if cyber criminals were to discover weak security controls
    on a bank’s customer login portal and found a way to take advantage of the security
    weakness to gain unauthorized access to multiple customers’ accounts, steal their
    **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**) and transfer fund out of their
    accounts. Even leverages the customers’ data as new and potential targets for
    future cyber-attacks, hence organizations also need to provide their customers’

    of public property. There is a type of threat actor who uses their hacking skills
    to perform malicious activities in support of a political or social agenda. This
    person is commonly referred to as a *hacktivist*. While some hacktivists use their

    organization and becoming an employee. Once this type of threat actor becomes
    an employee, the person will have access to the internal network and gain better
    insights into the network architecture and security vulnerabilities of the company.
    Therefore, this type of threat actor can implement network implants on the network

    defenses to protect their citizens, national assets and critical infrastructure
    from cyber criminals and other nations with malicious intent. Therefore, a government
    will hire *state-sponsored hackers* who are responsible for performing reconnaissance
    (intelligence gathering) on other countries and protecting their own country from

    been interesting and fascinating to many people around the world. Reverse engineering
    a system to better understand how it works has always attracted the curious minds.
    Similarly, hacking focuses on gaining a better understanding on how a system operates
    and function, if there are any flaws within its programming or design, and whether
    these security flaws can be exploited to alter the functionality of the system
    that enables the curious mind to take advantage of it. However, before a cyber-criminal
    launches any attack on a targeted organization, it’s important to plan the attack,
    evaluate the time and resources that are needed to perform the cyber-attack. Furthermore,
    the complexity of the attack and hack value of the target helps the threat actor
    to determine whether it’s worth moving forward with the plan of attack or not.

    a cyber-attack can take a threat actor anything from days to a few months of careful
    planning to ensure each phase is successful when executed in the proper order.
    Threat actors also need to consider the possibility that an attack or exploit
    might not work on the targeted system and this will create an unexpected delay
    during the process, which increases the time taken to meet the goals of the hack.
    Similarly, this concept can be applied to both ethical hackers and penetration

    process. However, using the right set of tools can help automate these tasks and
    improve the time taken to find security flaws and exploit them. Additionally,
    without the right skillset, a threat actor may experience some challenges in being
    successful in performing the cyber-attack. This can lead to seeking the support
    of additional persons with the skills needed to assist and contribute to achieving
    the objectives of the cyber-attack. Once again, this concept can be applied to
    security professionals such as penetration testers within the industry. Not everyone

    threat actors in discovering vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Imagine
    that threat actors are able to exploit a security vulnerability on a targeted
    system before a cybersecurity professional can find it and implement security
    controls and countermeasures to mitigate the threat. The longer cybersecurity
    professionals take to identify hidden security flaws on systems, the more time
    threat actors has to improve their cyber operations, exploit their targets and
    expand their foothold on a compromised network. This would leave the cybersecurity
    professional to perform incident handling and response to contain and eradicate
    the threat, and recover any compromised systems back to an acceptable working
    state.Organizations are realizing the need to hire white hat hackers such as ethical
    hackers and penetration testers with the skills needed to simulate real-world
    cyber-attacks on their systems and networks with the intention of discovering
    and exploiting hidden vulnerabilities to better understand the TTPs of cyber criminals.
    These techniques enables the ethical hacker and penetration tester to perform
    the same type of attacks as a real hacker; the difference is the penetration tester
    is hired by the organization and has been granted legal permission to conduct
    such intrusive security testing.

    recommendations on how to mitigate and prevent a possible cyber-attack on each
    vulnerability found. This allows the organization to better understand what type
    of information and systems a hacker will discover if they are targeted and the
    countermeasures which are needed to reduce the risk of a future cyber-attack.
    Some organizations will even perform a second penetration test after implementing
    the recommendations outlined in the penetration test reports to determine whether
    all the vulnerabilities have been fixed, the security controls are working as
    expected to mitigate the threats and the whether the attack surface is reduced.

    employer will not share or hold onto any sensitive or proprietary information
    that is encountered during the assessment. This is important to the customer as
    the penetration tester will be accessing their systems and may find confidential
    information. Companies usually sign these agreements with cybersecurity companies
    who will, in turn, sign them with the employees who are working on the project.
    In some cases, companies sign these agreements directly with the penetration testers
    from the company carrying out the project.The scope of a penetration test, also
    known as the *rules of engagement*, defines the systems and networks the penetration
    tester is authorized to perform security assessments on. In other words, it defines
    what the penetration tester is permitted and not permitted to hack, and whether
    there are any restricted tools and attacks. This ensures the penetration tester
    remains within legal boundaries. This is a mutual agreement between the client
    (customer) and the service provider (penetration tester). It also defines sensitive
    systems and their IP addresses as well as testing times, and which systems require
    special testing time-windows. It''s incredibly important for penetration testers

- en: Penetration testing is a lot like real-world hacking with the exception the
    penetration tester is limited to the scope and time allocated for the security
    assessment to be completed. Therefore, like a real cyber-attack, penetration testers
    need to perform sufficient reconnaissance to collect information from various
    data sources to create a profile about the targeted organization and identify
    security vulnerabilities. Information gathering is essential to ensure that penetration
    testers have access to key information that will assist them in successfully conducting
    their security assessments. Sometimes, a seasoned professional would normally
    spend a day or two conducting extensive reconnaissance on their target. The more
    knowledge that is known about the target will help the penetration tester to better
    identify the attack surface, such as points of entry in the targeted systems and
    networks. Additionally, this phase also helps the penetration tester to identify
    the employees, infrastructure, and geolocation for physical access, network details,
    servers, and other valuable information about the targeted organization.Understanding
    the target is very important before launching any type of attack as a penetration
    tester, as it helps in creating a profile of the potential target and determine
    which type of attacks are most effective based on the attack surface. Additionally,
    recovering user credentials/login accounts in this phase, for instance, will be
    valuable in later phases of penetration testing as it will help ethical hackers
    and penetration testers gain access to vulnerable systems and networks. Next,
    we will discuss the essentials of threat modeling.

- en: During the vulnerability analysis phase, the ethical hacker or penetration tester
    perform both manual and automated testing on targeted systems to identify hidden
    and unknown security flaws. Identifying security vulnerabilities within systems
    helps the organizations to better understand the attack surface, which is the
    vulnerable points of entry within their systems and network infrastructure. While
    many organizations implement and use automated vulnerability scanning tools, it’s
    also recommended to perform manual testing to determine whether a security vulnerability
    exists on a system and how to can be exploited by a real adversary, hence the
    need for penetration testing.Furthermore, the vulnerability helps the stakeholders
    and decision-makers in the organization to better determine how to allocation
    resources to higher priority systems. For instance, many automated vulnerability
    scanners provides a vulnerability score between 0 (lowest) – 10 (most severe)
    for each security flaw which are found on a system. The vulnerability scores can
    help organizations determine which security vulnerability on a system requires
    more attention and higher priority due the potential impact if the vulnerability
    were to be exploited by an adversary.In the later sections of the book, you will
    learn how to perform vulnerability assessments using various tools and techniques
    on targeted systems. After identifying the security weaknesses on a targeted system
    or network, the next phase is exploitation.

- en: As an ethical hacker and penetration tester, the next steps are discovering
    vulnerabilities on a targeted system, perform manual testing to validate whether
    these security vulnerabilities exists and determine how a real threat actor can
    compromise the system. Exploitation is sometimes the most challenging phase during
    a penetration test since you will need to either develop or acquire an exploit,
    modify and test it thoroughly to ensure it has the capabilities of taking advantage
    of the vulnerability on the targeted system. For many cybersecurity professionals,
    exploitation is the most exciting phase and feeling of breaking into a system.
    Exploitation is the ammunition or evidence that helps articulate why the vulnerability
    matters and illustrates the impact that the vulnerability could have on the organization.
    Furthermore, without exploitation, the assessment is not truly a penetration test
    and is nothing more than a vulnerability assessment, which most companies can
    conduct in-house better than a third-party consultant could.To put it simply,
    during the information gathering phase, a penetration tester will profile the
    target and identify any vulnerabilities. Next, using the information about the
    vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will do their research and create specific
    exploits that will take advantage of the vulnerabilities of the target—this is
    exploitation. We use exploits (malicious code) to leverage a vulnerability (weakness)
    in a system, which will allow us to execute arbitrary code and commands on the
    targeted system(s).Often, after successfully exploiting a targeted system or network,
    we may think the task is done—but it isn't just yet. There are tasks and objectives
    to complete after breaking into the system. Next, we’ll discuss the post-exploitation
    phase in penetration testing.

    to expand their foothold on the network by compromising additional systems and
    setting up backdoor access. This provides additional points of entry into the
    network infrastructure of the targeted organization. Similarly, ethical hackers
    and penetration testers apply common post-exploitation techniques such as *lateral
    movement* to compromise other systems on the network and setting up **Command
    and Control** (**C2**) operations to control multiple systems simultaneously.
    During post-exploitation, the primary goal is typically to demonstrate the impact
    that the vulnerability and access gained can pose to the targeted organization.
    This impact assists in helping executive leadership and decision-makers to better
    understand the risks, vulnerabilities and the damages it could cause to the organization
    if a threat were to target their company and assets.

    is the deliverable that the client/customer sees and is the only tangible element
    given to the client at the end of the security assessment. Reports should be given
    as much attention and care as the testing.Report writing involves much more than
    listing the security vulnerabilities that were found, their impact and recommendations.
    It is the medium through which you convey risk and business impact, summarize
    your findings, and include remediation steps. A good penetration tester also needs
    to be a good report writer, or the issues they find will be lost and may never
    be understood by the customer who hired them to conduct the assessment.Having
    completed this section, you are now able to describe each phase of a penetration
    test and have gained a better idea of the expectations of penetration testers

    to any form of penetration testing. The key difference between white, black, and
    gray box testing is the amount of information provided to the penetration testers
    prior to the engagement. In a white box assessment, the penetration tester is
    provided with full information about the targeted applications, systems and networks,
    and usually be given user credentials with varying degrees of access to quickly
    and thoroughly identify vulnerabilities in the targeted systems and networks.
    This approach reduces the time required by the ethical hacker and penetration
    tester to perform reconnaissance to identify the attack surface of the target.
    Not all security testing is done using the white box approach; sometimes, only
    the target targeted organization’s name is provided to the penetration tester.**Black
    box** assessments are one of the most common form of network penetration testing
    and are most typical among external network penetration tests and social engineering
    penetration tests. In a black box assessment, the penetration testers are given
    very little or no information about the targeted organization, its networks or
    systems, except the organization’s name. This particular form of testing is efficient
    when trying to determine what a real adversary will find and their strategies
    to gain unauthorized access to the organization's network and techniques for compromising
    their systems.**Gray box** assessments are a hybrid of white and black box testing
    and are typically used to provide a realistic testing scenario while also giving
    penetration testers enough information to reduce the time needed to conduct reconnaissance
    and other black box testing activities. In addition, it's important in any assessment
    to ensure you are testing all in-scope systems. In a true black box, it's possible
    to miss systems, and as a result, they are left out of the assessment.Each penetration
    test approach is a bit different from the others, and it's important that you
    know about all of them. Imagine a potential client calling to request a black
    box test on their external network infrastructure; as a penetration tester, we
    must be familiar with the terminologies and what is expected by the customer.

    the difference between a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. In
    a vulnerability assessment, the cybersecurity professional uses a vulnerability
    scanner, which is used to help identify the security posture of the targeted systems
    within the organization. These vulnerability scanners use various techniques to
    automate the process of discovering a wide range of security weaknesses on systems.The
    downside of using an automated vulnerability scanning tool is its incapability
    to identify the issues that manual testing can, and this is one of the many reasons
    why organizations hire penetration testers to perform these assessments on their
    systems. However, if the penetration tester only delivers the reports of the vulnerability
    scanning tools instead of performing manual testing during a network-based penetration
    test, in my opinion, this is highly unethical. During the course of this book,
    you will learn how to perform successful penetration testing using industry practices,

    human psychology (mind) to find human vulnerabilities and trick potential victims
    into doing things they may not otherwise do. For instance, adversaries will attempt
    to trick an employee within a targeted organization to connect a malware-infected
    USB drive to their computer or open a malware-infected attachment within an email
    message. In this form of penetration testing, you may be asked to do activities
    such as sending phishing emails, make vishing phone calls, or talk your way into
    secure facilities and connect a USB drive onto the system to determine what a

    we would like to be as undetectable as possible on a targeted network, not triggering
    any alerts on security sensors and appliances while we remove any residual traces
    of the actions performed during the penetration test. Covering your tracks ensures
    that you don't leave any trace of your presence on the network, as a penetration

    to both identify hidden security vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of
    the cyber defenses on the organization.Having completed this section, you have

    cybersecurity industry, it''s essential to understand the mindset of threat actors,
    adversaries and malicious actors. To be better at penetration testing, you need
    to develop a very creative and strategic mindset. To put it simply, you need to
    think like a real hacker if you are to compromise systems and networks as a cybersecurity
    professional.The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a seven-stage framework developed by
    Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace corporation. This framework outlines each
    critical step a threat actor will need to perform before they are successful in
    meeting the objectives and goals of the cyber-attack against their targets. Cybersecurity
    professionals will be able to reduce the likelihood of the threat actor meeting
    their goals and reduce the amount of damage if they are able to stop the attacker
    during the earlier phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.The following diagram shows
    the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain that are used by threat actors:'

    into the other until the adversary reaches the last phase, *actions on objectives*,
    where the threat actor has successfully reach their goals of the cyber-attack,
    and both the cyber defenses and cybersecurity team of the compromised organization
    was not able to stop the attack or hacker in their tracks. On the blue team side
    of cybersecurity operations, the security engineers need to ensure the systems
    and networks are very well protected and monitored for any potential threats.
    If a threat is detected, the blue team needs to analyze and contain (isolate)
    the threat as quickly as possible, preventing it from spread to other devices
    on the network. However, as an aspiring ethical hacker and penetration tester,
    we can apply the techniques and strategies used by threat actors which is associated
    to each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain to achieve our objectives during a real-world
    penetration test for an organization.In the next few sections, you will learn
    about the fundamentals of each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, how each is used
    by threat actors, and how penetration testers apply these strategies within their
    security assessments.

    information and intelligence about the target, whether it's a person or an organization.
    Threat actors and penetration testers use this stage to create a profile of their
    targets, which contains IP addresses, systems' operating systems, and open service
    ports, running applications, security vulnerabilities, and any sensitive resources
    that may be unintentionally exposed that can increase the attack surface.

    the geolocation of any physical offices, online services, domain names, network
    infrastructure, online servers and web applications, employee contact details,
    telephone numbers and email addresses, and so on. The main objective is to know
    as much information about the target. Sometimes this phase can take a long time.
    As compared to a penetration tester who has a specific time period to perform
    the entire penetration test, it can take between 1 to 2 days of intensive research
    before moving onto the next phase. However, since adversaries does not have any
    time constraints like ethical hackers and penetration testers, that can spend
    a lot more time collecting information, looking for security vulnerabilities and
    better plan their cyber-attacks on the target.

- en: Using the information gathered from the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor
    and penetration tester can use it to better craft a weapon, better referred to
    as an exploit, which can take advantage of a security vulnerability on the targeted
    system. The weapon (exploit) has to be specially crafted and tested to ensure
    its successful when launched by the threat actor or penetration tester. The objective
    of the exploit is to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability
    of the systems or networks that is owned by a targeted organization.Both threat
    actors and penetration testers need to consider the likelihood their exploit will
    be detected by any antimalware, **Endpoint Detection and Response** (**EDR**)
    and any threat detection solutions that’s monitoring the targeted systems and
    network. Therefore, it’s important to encode or disguise the exploit to reduce
    triggering any security sensors and alerting the security team.An exploit takes
    advantage of a vulnerability. After that happens, what's next? To be a bit more
    strategic, threat actors and penetration testers will couple their exploit with
    additional payloads. The payload is unleashed after the exploit has compromised
    the system. As a simple example, a payload can be used to create a persistent
    backdoor on the targeted system to allow the threat actor or the penetration tester
    remote access to the system at any time when the compromised system is online.

    has to use an attack vector as a method to deliver the exploit onto the targeted
    system. Delivery can be done using the creative mindset of the attacker, whether
    using email messaging, instant messaging services, or even by creating drive-by
    downloads on compromised web services. Another technique can be copying the exploit
    onto multiple USB drives and dropping them within the compound of the target organization,
    with the hope an employee will find it and connect it to an internal system due
    to human curiosity.The following is a picture of a USB Rubber Ducky that’s commonly
    used during ethical hacking and penetration testing:'

    tester to load malicious scripts onto the memory card. Once this device is connected
    to a computer, it’s detect as a **Human Interface Device** (**HID**) such as keyword,
    then executes the script on the targeted system. This is just one of many creative
    ideas of delivering a payload to a target. As an aspiring ethical hacker and penetration
    tester, ensure you have multiple methods of delivering the weapon to the target,
    such that, in the event that one method does not work, you have another, and alternative
    solutions.

    cyber defenses and this can create a halt in the Cyber Kill Chain. The attacker

    Cyber Kill Chain, the organization's blue team has failed to stop the attacker
    and preventing the cyber-attack. At this stage, the threat actor has completed
    their objectives and achieved the goals of the attack. In this phase, the attacker
    can complete the main objective of the attack, whether it's exfiltrating data
    from the organization and selling it on the dark web or even extending their botnet
    for a larger-scale cyber-attack on another target organization. Stopping the threat
    actor or penetration tester at this phase is considered to be extremely difficult
    as the attacker would have already established multiple persistent backdoor accesses
    with encrypted C2 communication channels on many compromised systems within the
    targeted organization. Furthermore, the threat actor will also be clearing traces
    of any evidence or artifacts that could help cybersecurity professionals to trace
    the source attack to the threat actor.Having completed this section, you have
    learned about the various stages of the Cyber Kill Chain and how it helps cybersecurity
    professionals understand the intentions of threat actors. Additionally, you have
    learned how penetration testers can implement these strategies within their penetration
