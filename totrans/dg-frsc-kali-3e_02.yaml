    those of you who may have purchased the previous editions, welcome back. I’d also
    like to sincerely thank you for once again choosing this exciting title. As with
    the second edition, this third edition has been updated with new tools, easy-to-follow
    labs, and a couple of new chapters. We have an exciting journey ahead of us, and
    I’m pleased to announce the inclusion of some major additions, including the installation
    of Wine, which will allow us to run Windows tools within Kali Linux and will be
    covered in its entirety in [*Chapter 5*](B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085)*, Installing
    Wine in Kali Linux*. [*Chapter 10*](B19441_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor191), *Memory
    Forensics and Analysis with Volatility 3*, is also brand-new and shows how to
    perform RAM artifact analysis on newer operating systems. Another new chapter
    on using the Autopsy v4 **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) to perform full
    **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** (**DFIR**) analysis and investigations
    can be found in [*Chapter 13*](B19441_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234), *Performing
    a Full DFIR Analysis with the Autopsy* *4 GUI*.

    creating a portable Kali Linux box using Raspberry Pi 4 and learning about tools
    such as DD-rescue, scrounge-ntfs, Magic Rescue, PDF-Parser, Timeliner, netdiscover,
    and introduce **Shodan.io** and **apackets.com** for **Internet of Things** (**IoT**)
    discovery and packet analysis.

- en: Digital forensics has had my attention for well over 15 years. Ever since I
    was given my first PC (thanks, Mom and Dad), I’ve always wondered what happened
    when I deleted my files from my massively large 2 GB (**Gigabyte**) hard drive
    or moved my files to (and often hid them on) a less-than-inconspicuous 3.5-inch
    floppy diskette that maxed out at 1.44 MB (**Megabytes**) in capacity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    immortality I so confidently believed in. Sadly, many files, documents, and priceless
    fine art created in Microsoft Paint by yours truly were lost to the digital afterlife,
    never to be retrieved again. Sigh. The world shall never know.

    associated tools while browsing the magical **World Wide Web** (**WWW**) on my
    lightning-fast 42 Kbps dial-up internet connection (made possible by my very expensive
    USRobotics dial-up modem), which sang the tune of the technology gods every time
    I tried to connect to the realm of the internet. This process involved a stealthy
    ninja-like skill that would make even a black-ops team envious, as it involved
    doing so without my parents noticing, as this would prevent them from using the
    telephone line to make or receive phone calls (apologies, dear Mother, Father,
    and older teenage sister).

    as the many great peer-reviewed papers, journals, and books on digital forensics
    widely available today. As a total novice (also referred to as a noob) in the
    field, I did learn a great deal about the basics of file systems, data and metadata,
    storage measurements, and the workings of various storage media. It was at this
    time that, even though I had read about the Linux operating system and its various
    distributions (or distros), I began to get an understanding of why Linux distros
    were popular for data recovery and forensics.
  prefs: []

    on a dial-up connection. Just downloading these operating systems was quite a
    feat, which left me feeling highly accomplished as I did not have any clue as
    to how to install them, let alone actually use them. In those days, easy installation
    and GUIs were still under heavy development, as user-friendly, or in my case,
    user-unfriendly, as they were at the time (mostly due to my inexperience, lack
    of recommended hardware, and also lack of resources, such as online forums, blogs,
    and YouTube, which I did not yet know about).

    Macintosh, and many Linux distributions. I found that many of the tools used in
    digital forensics could be installed on various Linux distributions or flavors,
    and many of these tools were well maintained, constantly being developed, and
    widely accepted by peers in the field. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution or flavor,
    but before we go any further, let me explain the concept of a Linux distribution
    or flavor. Consider your favorite beverage: this beverage can come in many flavors,
    some without sweeteners or sugar, in different colors, and even in various sizes.
    No matter the variations, it’s still the basic ingredients that comprise the beverage
    at the core. In this way, too, we have Linux and then different types and varieties
    of Linux. Some more popular Linux distros and flavors include RedHat, CentOS,
    Ubuntu, Mint, KNOPPIX, and, of course, Kali Linux. More on Kali Linux will be
    discussed in [*Chapter 3*](B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Installing* *Kali

- en: Kali Linux is a Debian-based operating system used globally by cyber security
    professionals, students, and IT enthusiasts. Debian is a flavor of Linux that
    is completely free, stable, constantly updated, supports many types of hardware,
    and is also used by popular operating systems such as Ubuntu and Zorin. Kali Linux
    is certainly not new to the cybersecurity field and even goes back to the mid-2000s,
    but it was known then as BackTrack, which was a combination of two platforms called
    Auditor Security and Whax. This merge happened in 2006, with subsequent versions
    of BackTrack being released up to 2011 when BackTrack 5, based on Ubuntu 10.04,
    was released.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2013, *Offensive Security* released the first version of Kali v1 (Moto),
    which was based on Debian 7, and then Kali v2 in 2015, which was based on Debian
    8\. Following this, Kali Linux Rolling was released in 2016, with the names of
    the distribution reflecting both the year of release and the major update of the
    quarterly period. For example, at the time of writing, I use Kali **2022.3** and
    **2022.4**, both based on recent versions of Debian. You can find more on the
    open source and free Debian Project at [https://www.debian.org/intro/about](https://www.debian.org/intro/about).

    **penetration tester** (**pentester**), and subject matter expert in DFIR, I have
    used BackTrack and now Kali Linux for well over a decade since I first came across
    it when I started studying for the Certified Ethical Hacker exam in 2006\. Since
    then, I’ve used a myriad of operating systems for pentesting and digital forensics,
    but my main tool of choice, particularly for pentesting, is Kali Linux. Although
    Kali Linux has focused less on DFIR and more on penetration testing, it makes
    it much easier for me to have both penetration testing and DFIR tools on one platform
    rather than have to switch between them.

    book, I’d say you’re certainly in for a treat as I’ve not only updated many labs
    and introduced new tools in this edition, but I’ve also included a chapter on
    installing Wine in Kali Linux. **Windows Emulator** (**Wine**) allows you to run
    Windows applications in Kali Linux. Although it takes a bit of configuration,
    I’ve compiled a step-by-step guide on how to install Wine in [*Chapter 5*](B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085),
    *Installing Wine in* *Kali Linux*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of you may be wondering why we would install Wine instead of simply using
    a Windows machine. There are quite a few valid reasons actually. Firstly, cost
    is a major factor. Windows licenses aren’t cheap if you’re a student, in between
    jobs, changing careers, or live in a region where the exchange rate and forex
    are limiting factors in purchasing licensing. At the time of writing, the cost
    of a Windows 10 Professional license is $199.00, as listed on Microsoft’s site
    at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

    amazing free DFIR tools that are available for Windows, such as **Belkasoft RAM
    Capturer**, **Autopsy 4 GUI**, and **NetworkMiner**, which we can now install
    within our open source Kali Linux environment instead of on a licensed Windows
    machine. These tools will be covered in detail in [*Chapter 8*](B19441_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147),
    *Evidence Acquisition Tools*, [*Chapter 13*](B19441_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234),

    *Network Forensic Analysis* *Tools*, respectively.

    between physical machines and can also save on resource utilization such as **Random
    Access Memory** (**RAM**), **Central Processing Unit** (**CPU**), **Hard Disk
    Drive** (**HDD**) space, and other resources when using virtual machines, which
    we will discuss more in detail in the next chapter.

    tools, whether they be productivity tools or even tools for penetration testing,
    thus making our Kali Linux installation the perfect purple teaming operating system

    manually rather than downloading a very large installation file. Kali Linux (meta)packages
    contain tools and dependencies that may be specific to an assessment or task,
    such as information gathering, vulnerability assessments, wireless hacking, and
    forensics. Alternatively, a user can download the **kali-linux-everything (meta)package**.
    We’ll go into more detail about (meta)package installations in [*Chapter 4*](B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072),

    available for a multitude of physical, virtual, mobile, and portable devices.
    Kali is available as a standalone operating system image and can also be installed
    virtually using their pre-built images for virtual platforms such as VMware and
    VirtualBox, which will be covered in detail in [*Chapter 3*](B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058),
    *Installing Kali Linux*, and [*Chapter 4*](B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072),
    *Additional Kali Installations and Post-Installation Tasks*. There are also versions
    of Kali for ARM devices, cloud instances, and even the ability to run Kali Linux
    in Windows 10 under the **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (**WSL**). On a personal
    note, I also use the mobile version of Kali Linux called Kali NetHunter on an
    old OnePlus phone and also on a Raspberry Pi 4, which, when connected to a power
    bank, serve as the ultimate portable security assessment toolkit. As far as installation
    on mobile phones goes, NetHunter (and even Kali Linux itself in some cases) can
    be installed on a variety of phones from Samsung, Nokia, OnePlus, Sony, Xiaomi,
    Google, or ZTE. We’ll look at installing Kali Linux in VirtualBox and Raspberry
    Pi 4 in [*Chapter 4*](B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072), *Additional Kali Installations

    is the name given to the collective of individuals responsible for handling the
    offensive side of security as it relates to OSINT, scanning, vulnerability assessments,
    and the penetration testing of resources, including but not limited to individuals,
    companies, host end users (desktops, laptops, mobiles), and network and critical
    infrastructure such as servers, routers, switches, firewalls, NAS, databases,
    WebApps, and portals. There are also systems such as IoT, **Operational Technology**
    (**OT**) devices, and **Industrial Control Systems** (**ICS**), which also require
    assessments by highly skilled red teamers.

    testers who, apart from having the skill sets to conduct the assessments listed
    previously, may also have the technical certifications that allow them to do so.

    they have been known to aid in obtaining jobs.

    threat actors and essentially hack systems and security mechanisms in the same
    manner in which malicious actors would compromise and exploit the attack surface
    of an individual, company, or valued asset.

    of offensive security and red teaming assessments. On a personal note, Kali Linux
    is my go-to operating system of choice for penetration testing as most of the
    tools required for fingerprinting, reconnaissance, OSINT, vulnerability assessments,
    exploitation, and reporting are all readily available and preinstalled on the
    platform. I’ve been using Kali to conduct red team exercises for over 12 years
    and I don’t see that changing anytime soon, as they’ve always maintained the OS
    and support for tools over the years.

    the offensive, as previously written about red teamers. While red teamers focus
    on threat simulation and possible exploitation, blue teamers are the protectors
    of the realm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Red and blue teamers are quite similar when considering that the main goal of
    each team is mainly to protect resources and understand the potential impact and
    risk associated with breaches and data leaks. The red team may focus on attack
    techniques, such as the cyber kill chain and penetration testing, whereas the
    blue team then focuses on ensuring that not only are mechanisms in place to protect
    against attacks but also that formal policies, procedures, and even frameworks
    are implemented to assure effective DFIR.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The work of a blue teamer covers far more than that of a red teamer, as blue
    teamers must analyze threats, understand their risk and impact, implement security
    and protective measures, understand forensics and incident response, and ensure
    that effective monitoring, response services, and measures are implemented. It
    also certainly helps if a blue teamer has the knowledge or experience of a red
    teamer, as this provides an additional depth of understanding of attack surfaces
    and threat landscapes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blue teamers must also be knowledgeable about a wide scope of technology and
    analytics. While it is not impossible for people new to IT to get into blue teaming
    and DFIR, it does require prior knowledge along the lines of a network and systems
    administrator and also of a security analyst and threat hunter. For example, understanding
    that systems must be updated and patched accordingly is more of a best practice.
    The blue teamer will understand why there is a need for patching and also understand
    that there is much more to be done when hardening devices to reduce attack surfaces
    while also taking into consideration the possibilities of zero-day exploits and
    even human weaknesses, which may easily facilitate a breach by a threat actor
    and then circumvent all technical measures implemented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also not uncommon to see job posts asking that blue teamers be proficient
    in **Security Information and Event Management** (**SIEM**) tools, which provide
    real-time analysis, monitoring, and alerts that greatly aid in DFIR management
    and allow for a greater understanding of the level of protection required in maintaining
    a high-security posture rating when safeguarding data, systems, and assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blue teamers must also accept that their responsibilities do not only apply
    to internal and external resources but will be extended when considering the threat
    landscape of the assets to be protected. The threat landscape can be devices,
    persons, data, and any information that may be useful to an attacker when planning
    an attack. This is where an in-depth understanding of OSINT comes in. Although
    previously mentioned as a red teaming skill set, this proves equally important
    to the blue teamer in being able to scout the internet, social media, and the
    dark web for any information that could either pose a threat or aid the threat
    actor in some way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good example would be to search the dark web for breach databases where the
    blue teamer (after taking all necessary precautions to protect themselves) browses
    the dark web in search of compromised emails or **Virtual Private Network** (**VPN**)
    credentials of the company they work for. The blue teamer may also use a site
    such as Shodan.io, which we will cover later on in this book, to find accessible
    devices from an external perspective, such as external access to firewalls, servers,
    and CCTV cameras. All of the preceding scenarios aid the blue teamer in developing
    what is known as a threat profile, which, while not directly focusing on internal
    and external assets, will still compile potential threats and even **Indicators
    of Compromise** (**IoC**) found externally.

    The term **purple teaming** refers to the combination of skill sets in red and
    blue teaming. The color purple can also be achieved by mixing the colors red and
    blue, hence the name purple teaming. Looking back at all the skill sets and certifications
    mentioned in the red and blue teaming sections, it may seem like an impossible
    accomplishment; however, I guarantee you that there are many purple teamers out
    there who started as novices and ended up as professionals, myself included.

    interested in ethical hacking and pentesting (red teaming) at that point in time
    and spent many a night in front of my desktop reading, researching, and using
    the very limited tools available at that time. It was not until perhaps 2008 that
    I decided to get into DFIR and became very interested in the field of forensics,
    to the point where I started to teach the CHFI course alongside the CEH course.

    new tool that would point me in the direction of the other. Thankfully, this all
    worked out in my favor as I soon realized that red and blue teaming overlap in
    many aspects and also that there was never a point where I could say that what
    I had already learned was enough. My point here is that cybersecurity is such
    a dynamic field with so many paths that you can never know just enough. There
    is always some new exploit, an investigative tool, or an incident response procedure
    to learn, and it’s up to you to decide whether you would like to specialize in
    one field or continue to learn and grow as I did and apply your knowledge when
    necessary.

    Institute, where I not only lead a purple team but I’m also the lead penetration
    tester as well as the lead forensic and incident response investigator. Again,
    it is very much possible to be well versed in both fields once you commit to it.

    to get started, as it offers the best tools for purple teaming. Let’s have a sneak
    peek at some of the exploitation (red teaming tools) available to us, which are
    all preinstalled with any version of Kali.

    however, I use the **metasploit framework**, the **msf payload creator**, and
    the **social engineering toolkit (root)** religiously for red team assessments.

    found by viewing the **All Applications** menu, which we will explore in [*Chapter
    3*](B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Installing Kali Linux*. Kali Linux is
    one of the few user-friendly platforms that offers a variety of tools for purple
    teaming, and I look forward to showing you how to effectively use many of them
    in the coming chapters.

    I’ll show you, step by step, how to set up Kali Linux in a safe, virtual test
    environment where we can use our tools and download sample files for analysis.
    Although this virtual machine will be connected to the internet, we will use it
    in a sandboxed environment to ensure that it does not affect your production environment.
    In [*Chapter 5*](B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085), *Installing Wine in Kali Linux*,
    I will also walk you through the process of installing Wine in Kali Linux to help
    build your ultimate blue and purple team arsenal of tools that will now combine
    the best open source Windows and Linux tools.

    we will be moving on to understand digital forensics and also have a look at other
    forensic platforms and some commercial tools and quite importantly, gain some
    insight into forensic frameworks in [*Chapter 2*](B19441_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024),
    *Introduction to* *Digital Forensics*.

- en: In this chapter, we were introduced to Kali Linux’s Debian-based operating system
    and its usefulness in the world of cybersecurity. We also learned about the different
    teams in cybersecurity, such as red teams, comprised of individuals concerned
    with offensive security and ethical hacking, such as penetration testers, and
    blue teams, comprised of individuals concerned with defending networks and data,
    such as forensic investigators. We also learned that having both red and blue
    teaming skill sets and experience puts an individual into the highly skilled purple
    team, which suggests that the individual is versed in a wide range of tools for
    vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and also incident response and
    digital forensics, many of which can be found in Kali Linux.
