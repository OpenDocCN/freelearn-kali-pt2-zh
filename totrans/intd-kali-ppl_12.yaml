- en: In this part, you’ll learn a little bit about how Kali Purple supports digital
    forensics. You’ll also take a practical dive into offensive security and be introduced
    to a bunch of tools that can be used to test against cyber defenses. The tools
    you can expect to cover include OWASP ZAP, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite,
    Nmap, SQLmap, Nikto Nessus, Hydra, Medusa, and John-the-Ripper. You’ll round out
    this part by playing with Kali Autopilot’s automation application, gaining experience
    recognizing Python code, and understanding the NIST CSF framework that Kali Purple
    is built around.
