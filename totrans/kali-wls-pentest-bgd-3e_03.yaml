    feature and are relatively simple to beat. MAC address filters do not provide
    any security, as MAC addresses can be sniffed from the air from the wireless packets.
    This is possible because the MAC addresses are unencrypted in the packet. Open
    Authentication provides no real authentication at all. SKA is a bit tricky to
    beat but, with the help of the right tools, we can derive the store and the keystream,
    using which it is possible to answer all future challenges sent by the access
    point. The result is that we can authenticate without needing to know the actual
    key.

  zh: 在本章中，我们学习了WLAN认证。隐藏SSID是一种安全隐蔽特性，相对容易被突破。MAC地址过滤并不提供任何安全性，因为MAC地址可以通过无线数据包从空中嗅探到。这是可能的，因为MAC地址在数据包中是未加密的。开放认证根本不提供任何真实的认证。SKA虽然有点难以突破，但借助合适的工具，我们可以推导出存储和密钥流，从而能够回应接入点发送的所有未来挑战。结果是，我们可以在不需要知道实际密钥的情况下完成认证。

    WPA, and WPA2—and look at the insecurities that plague them.
