<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Red, Blue, and Purple Teaming Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Welcome to the third edition of <em class="italic">Digital Forensics with Kali Linux</em>, and for those of you who may have purchased the previous editions, welcome back. I’d also like to sincerely thank you for once again choosing this exciting title. As with the second edition, this third edition has been updated with new tools, easy-to-follow labs, and a couple of new chapters. We have an exciting journey ahead of us, and I’m pleased to announce the inclusion of some major additions, including the installation of Wine, which will allow us to run Windows tools within Kali Linux and will be covered in its entirety in <a href="B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Installing Wine in Kali Linux</em>. <a href="B19441_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor191"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Memory Forensics and Analysis with Volatility 3</em>, is also brand-new and shows how to perform RAM artifact analysis on newer operating systems. Another <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>new chapter on using the Autopsy v4 <strong class="bold">Graphical User Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) to perform full <strong class="bold">Digital Forensics and Incident Response</strong> (<strong class="bold">DFIR</strong>) analysis <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>and investigations can be found in <a href="B19441_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Performing a Full DFIR Analysis with the Autopsy </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">4 GUI</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Besides these major additions, we will also look at some new topics, such as creating a portable Kali Linux box using Raspberry Pi 4 and learning about tools such as DD-rescue, scrounge-ntfs, Magic <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>Rescue, PDF-Parser, Timeliner, netdiscover, and introduce <strong class="bold">Shodan.io</strong> and <strong class="bold">apackets.com</strong> for <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) discovery and <span class="No-Break">packet analysis.</span></p>
<p>For this book, we take a very structured approach to digital forensics, as we would in forensic science. First, we will stroll into the world of digital forensics, its history, and some of the tools and operating systems used for forensics, and we will immediately introduce you to the concepts involved in <span class="No-Break">evidence preservation.</span></p>
<p>With that said, we have a lot to cover and will start by learning about Kali and the various cybersecurity teams and the differences between red, blue, and purple teaming. For our returning and advanced readers who may have prior knowledge of Kali Linux and the respective teams, feel free to skim through the first two chapters and get straight into the practical aspects in <a href="B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Kali Linux</em>, <a href="B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Additional Kali Installations and Post-Installation Tasks</em>, and <a href="B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Wine in Kali Linux</em>, which detail the installations of Kali <span class="No-Break">and Wine.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">key topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>What is <span class="No-Break">Kali Linux?</span></li>
<li>Understanding <span class="No-Break">red teaming</span></li>
<li>Understanding <span class="No-Break">blue teaming</span></li>
<li>Understanding <span class="No-Break">purple teaming</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get started with these topics, the following is a sneak peek at how I got into the world of Kali Linux, as I feel some of you will be able to relate to <span class="No-Break">my story!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>How I got started with Kali Linux</h1>
<p>Digital forensics <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>has had my attention for well over 15 years. Ever since I was given my first PC (thanks, Mom and Dad), I’ve always wondered what happened when I deleted my files from my massively large 2 GB (<strong class="bold">Gigabyte</strong>) hard drive or moved my files to (and often hid them on) a less-than-inconspicuous 3.5-inch floppy diskette that maxed out at 1.44 MB (<strong class="bold">Megabytes</strong>) <span class="No-Break">in capacity.</span></p>
<p>I soon learned that hard and floppy disk drives did not possess the digital immortality I so confidently believed in. Sadly, many files, documents, and priceless fine art created in Microsoft Paint by yours truly were lost to the digital afterlife, never to be retrieved again. Sigh. The world shall <span class="No-Break">never know.</span></p>
<p>It wasn’t until years later that I came across an article on file recovery and associated tools while <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>browsing the magical <strong class="bold">World Wide Web</strong> (<strong class="bold">WWW</strong>) on my lightning-fast 42 Kbps dial-up internet connection (made possible by my very expensive USRobotics dial-up modem), which sang the tune of the technology gods every time I tried to connect to the realm of the internet. This process involved a stealthy ninja-like skill that would make even a black-ops team envious, as it involved doing so without my parents noticing, as this would prevent them from using the telephone line to make or receive phone calls (apologies, dear Mother, Father, and older <span class="No-Break">teenage sister).</span></p>
<p>The previous article on data recovery wasn’t anywhere near as detailed and fact-filled as the many great <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>peer-reviewed papers, journals, and books on digital forensics widely available today. As a total novice (also referred to as a noob) in the field, I did learn a great deal about the basics of file systems, data and metadata, storage measurements, and the workings of various storage media. It was at this time that, even though I had read about the Linux operating system and its various distributions (or distros), I began to get an understanding of why Linux distros were popular for data recovery <span class="No-Break">and forensics.</span></p>
<p>I managed to bravely download the Auditor and Slax Linux distributions, again on a dial-up connection. Just downloading these operating systems was quite a feat, which left me feeling highly accomplished as I did not have any clue as to how to install them, let alone actually use them. In those days, easy installation and GUIs were still under heavy development, as user-friendly, or in my case, user-unfriendly, as they were at the time (mostly due to my inexperience, lack of recommended hardware, and also lack of resources, such as online forums, blogs, and YouTube, which I did not yet <span class="No-Break">know about).</span></p>
<p>As time passed, I researched many tools found on various platforms for Windows, Macintosh, and many Linux distributions. I found that many of the tools used in digital forensics could be <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>installed on various Linux distributions or flavors, and many of these tools were well maintained, constantly being developed, and widely accepted by peers in the field. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution or flavor, but before we go any further, let me explain the concept of a Linux distribution or flavor. Consider your favorite beverage: this beverage can come in many flavors, some without sweeteners or sugar, in different colors, and even in various sizes. No matter the variations, it’s still the basic ingredients that comprise the beverage at the core. In this way, too, we have Linux and then different types and varieties of Linux. Some more popular Linux distros and flavors include RedHat, CentOS, Ubuntu, Mint, KNOPPIX, and, of course, Kali Linux. More on Kali Linux will be discussed in <a href="B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Kali Linux</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>With that said, let’s move on to our next section as we get started with exploring the enchanting world of <span class="No-Break">Kali Linux!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>What is Kali Linux?</h1>
<p>Kali Linux is a Debian-based operating system used globally by cyber security professionals, students, and IT enthusiasts. Debian is a flavor of Linux that is completely free, stable, constantly updated, supports many types of hardware, and is also used by popular operating systems such as Ubuntu and Zorin. Kali Linux is certainly not new to the cybersecurity field and even goes back to the mid-2000s, but it was known then as BackTrack, which was a combination of two platforms called Auditor Security and Whax. This merge happened in 2006, with subsequent versions of BackTrack being released up to 2011 when BackTrack 5, based on Ubuntu 10.04, <span class="No-Break">was released.</span></p>
<p>In 2013, <em class="italic">Offensive Security</em> released the first version of Kali v1 (Moto), which was based on Debian 7, and then Kali v2 in 2015, which was based on Debian 8. Following this, Kali Linux Rolling was released in 2016, with the names of the distribution reflecting both the year of release and the major update of the quarterly period. For example, at the time of writing, I use Kali <strong class="source-inline">2022.3</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">2022.4</strong>, both based on recent versions of Debian. You can find more on the open source and free Debian Project <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/about"><span class="No-Break">https://www.debian.org/intro/about</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>As a cybersecurity <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>professional, a <strong class="bold">Chief Information Security Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CISO</strong>), <strong class="bold">penetration tester</strong> (<strong class="bold">pentester</strong>), and subject matter <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>expert in DFIR, I have used BackTrack and now Kali Linux for well over a decade <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>since I first came across it when I started studying for the Certified Ethical Hacker exam in 2006. Since then, I’ve used a myriad of operating systems for pentesting and digital forensics, but my main tool of choice, particularly for pentesting, is Kali Linux. Although Kali Linux has focused less on DFIR and more on penetration testing, it makes it much easier for me to have both penetration testing and DFIR tools on one platform rather than have to switch <span class="No-Break">between them.</span></p>
<p>For our readers who <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>may have purchased the first and second editions of this book, I’d say you’re certainly in for a treat as I’ve not only updated many labs and introduced new tools in this edition, but I’ve also included a chapter on installing Wine in Kali Linux. <strong class="bold">Windows Emulator</strong> (<strong class="bold">Wine</strong>) allows you to run Windows applications in Kali Linux. Although it takes a bit of configuration, I’ve compiled a step-by-step guide on how to install Wine in <a href="B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Wine in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Kali Linux</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering why we would install Wine instead of simply using a Windows machine. There are quite a few valid reasons actually. Firstly, cost is a major factor. Windows licenses aren’t cheap if you’re a student, in between jobs, changing careers, or live in a region where the exchange rate and forex are limiting factors in purchasing licensing. At the time of writing, the cost of a Windows 10 Professional license is $199.00, as listed on Microsoft’s site <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab"><span class="No-Break">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Although we will not be using commercial tools in this book, there are some amazing free DFIR <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>tools that are <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>available for Windows, such as <strong class="bold">Belkasoft RAM Capturer</strong>, <strong class="bold">Autopsy 4 GUI</strong>, and <strong class="bold">NetworkMiner</strong>, which we <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>can now install within our open source Kali Linux environment instead of on a licensed Windows machine. These tools will be covered in detail in <a href="B19441_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Evidence Acquisition Tools</em>, <a href="B19441_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Performing a Full DFIR Analysis with the Autopsy 4 GUI</em>, and <a href="B19441_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor262"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Network Forensic Analysis </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Tools</em></span><span class="No-Break">, respectively.</span></p>
<p>Another consideration is that Wine again saves us the hassle of having to switch between physical <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>machines and can also save on resource <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>utilization such as <strong class="bold">Random Access Memory</strong> (<strong class="bold">RAM</strong>), <strong class="bold">Central Processing Unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">CPU</strong>), <strong class="bold">Hard Disk Drive </strong>(<strong class="bold">HDD</strong>) space, and other <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>resources when using virtual machines, which we will discuss more in detail in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we can install many other Windows applications in Kali Linux using tools, whether they be productivity tools or even tools for penetration testing, thus making our Kali Linux installation the perfect purple teaming operating system environment, which we will discuss later in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Why is Kali Linux so popular?</h2>
<p>Aside from being one of the oldest, InfoSec distros (distributions), Kali Linux has a very large support base, and you can find thousands of tutorials on installation, using built-in tools, and installing <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>additional tools on YouTube, TikTok, and the internet at large, making it one of the more <span class="No-Break">user-friendly platforms.</span></p>
<p>Kali Linux also comes with over 600 tools, all of which are nicely categorized in Kali’s <strong class="bold">Applications</strong> menu. Many <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>of the tools included in Kali can perform various cybersecurity tasks ranging from <strong class="bold">Open Source Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSINT</strong>), scanning, vulnerability assessments, exploitation and penetration testing, office and productivity tools, and, of course, DFIR. The full listing of tools can be found <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/all-tools/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.kali.org/tools/all-tools/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>The following screenshot gives a preview of the category listings in the Kali <span class="No-Break">Linux menu.</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Category listing in the Kali Linux menu</p>
<p>Kali Linux users <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>also have the option to download and install (meta)packages manually rather than downloading a very large installation file. Kali Linux (meta)packages contain tools and dependencies that may be specific to an assessment or task, such as information gathering, vulnerability assessments, wireless hacking, and forensics. Alternatively, a user can download the <strong class="bold">kali-linux-everything (meta)package</strong>. We’ll go into more detail about (meta)package installations in <a href="B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Additional Kali Installations and Post-Installation Tasks</em>, but if you’d like to know more <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>about what (meta)packages exist, you can find the full listing <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Yet another reason why Kali Linux is so popular is that there are several versions available for a multitude of physical, virtual, mobile, and portable devices. Kali is available as a <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>standalone operating system image and can also be installed virtually using their pre-built images for virtual platforms such as VMware and VirtualBox, which will be covered in detail in <a href="B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Kali Linux</em>, and <a href="B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Additional Kali Installations and Post-Installation Tasks</em>. There are also versions of Kali for ARM devices, cloud instances, and even the ability to run Kali Linux in <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>Windows 10 under the <strong class="bold">Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSL</strong>). On a personal note, I also use the mobile version of Kali Linux called Kali NetHunter on an old OnePlus phone and also on a Raspberry Pi 4, which, when connected to a power bank, serve as the ultimate portable security assessment toolkit. As far as installation on mobile phones goes, NetHunter (and even Kali Linux itself in some cases) can be installed on a variety of phones from Samsung, Nokia, OnePlus, Sony, Xiaomi, Google, or ZTE. We’ll look at installing Kali Linux in VirtualBox and Raspberry Pi 4 in <a href="B19441_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Additional Kali Installations and </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Post-Installation Tasks</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>The fact that Kali Linux offers all these features for free and can be easily upgraded with the addition of new tools just a couple of clicks and commands away makes it the perfect purple teaming solution. Let’s take a look at red, blue, and purple teaming and the skillsets required for <span class="No-Break">each team.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Understanding red teaming</h1>
<p>Possibly the most <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>commonly known team among users of Kali Linux, the red team is the name given to the collective of individuals responsible for handling the offensive side of security as it relates to OSINT, scanning, vulnerability assessments, and the penetration testing of resources, including but not limited to individuals, companies, host end users (desktops, laptops, mobiles), and network and critical infrastructure such as servers, routers, switches, firewalls, NAS, databases, WebApps, and portals. There are also systems such <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>as IoT, <strong class="bold">Operational Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">OT</strong>) devices, and <strong class="bold">Industrial Control Systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">ICS</strong>), which also require <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>assessments by highly skilled <span class="No-Break">red teamers.</span></p>
<p>Red teamers are generally thought of as highly skilled ethical hackers and penetration testers who, apart from having the skill sets to conduct the assessments listed previously, may also <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>have the technical certifications that allow them to do so. Although certifications may not directly reflect the abilities of the individuals, they have been known to aid in <span class="No-Break">obtaining jobs.</span></p>
<p>Some red teaming <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>certifications include (but are not <span class="No-Break">limited to):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Offensive Security Certified Professional</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSCP</strong>): Developed <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>by the creators of <span class="No-Break">Kali Linux</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Certified Ethical Hacker</strong> (<strong class="bold">CEH</strong>): From <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/><span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">EC-Council</em></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Practical Network Penetration Tester</strong> (<strong class="bold">PNPT</strong>): Developed <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>by <span class="No-Break">TCM Security</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pentest+</strong>: <span class="No-Break">By </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/></span><span class="No-Break">CompTIA</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">SANS SEC</strong>: Courses <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>from the <span class="No-Break">SANS Institute</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">e-Learn Junior Penetration Tester</strong> (<strong class="bold">eJPT</strong>): Developed by <em class="italic">e-Learn Security</em> for beginners <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>interested in becoming <span class="No-Break">red teamers</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, all of this knowledge allows red teamers to conduct offensive attacks (with explicit permission) against companies to simulate internal and external threat actors and essentially hack systems and security mechanisms in the same manner in which malicious actors would compromise and exploit the attack surface of an individual, company, or <span class="No-Break">valued asset.</span></p>
<p>Kali Linux generally contains all the tools required to perform almost all types of offensive security and red teaming assessments. On a personal note, Kali Linux is my go-to operating system of choice for penetration testing as most of the tools required for fingerprinting, reconnaissance, OSINT, vulnerability assessments, exploitation, and reporting are all readily available and preinstalled on the platform. I’ve been using Kali to conduct red team exercises for over 12 years and I don’t see that changing anytime soon, as they’ve always maintained the OS and support for tools over <span class="No-Break">the years.</span></p>
<p>Let’s move on to blue <span class="No-Break">teaming now.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Understanding blue teaming</h1>
<p>Blue teamers are generally considered to be on the defensive side rather than the offensive, as previously <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>written about red teamers. While red teamers focus on threat simulation and possible exploitation, blue teamers are the protectors of <span class="No-Break">the realm.</span></p>
<p>Red and blue teamers are quite similar when considering that the main goal of each team is mainly to protect resources and understand the potential impact and risk associated with breaches and data leaks. The red team may focus on attack techniques, such as the cyber kill chain and penetration testing, whereas the blue team then focuses on ensuring that not only are mechanisms in place to protect against attacks but also that formal policies, procedures, and even frameworks are implemented to assure <span class="No-Break">effective DFIR.</span></p>
<p>The work of a blue teamer covers far more than that of a red teamer, as blue teamers must analyze threats, understand their risk and impact, implement security and protective measures, understand forensics and incident response, and ensure that effective monitoring, response services, and measures are implemented. It also certainly helps if a blue teamer has the knowledge or experience of a red teamer, as this provides an additional depth of understanding of attack surfaces and <span class="No-Break">threat landscapes.</span></p>
<p>Blue teamers must also be knowledgeable about a wide scope of technology and analytics. While it is not impossible for people new to IT to get into blue teaming and DFIR, it does require prior knowledge along the lines of a network and systems administrator and also of a security analyst and threat hunter. For example, understanding that systems must be updated and patched accordingly is more of a best practice. The blue teamer will understand why there is a need for patching and also understand that there is much more to be done when hardening devices to reduce attack surfaces while also taking into consideration the possibilities of zero-day exploits and even human weaknesses, which may easily facilitate a breach by a threat actor and then circumvent all technical <span class="No-Break">measures implemented.</span></p>
<p>It is also not uncommon to see job posts asking that blue teamers be proficient in <strong class="bold">Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIEM</strong>) tools, which provide real-time analysis, monitoring, and <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>alerts that greatly aid in DFIR management and allow for a greater understanding of the level of protection required in maintaining a high-security posture rating when safeguarding data, systems, <span class="No-Break">and assets.</span></p>
<p>Blue teamers must also accept that their responsibilities do not only apply to internal and external resources but will be extended when considering the threat landscape of the assets to be protected. The threat landscape can be devices, persons, data, and any information that may <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>be useful to an attacker when planning an attack. This is where an in-depth understanding of OSINT comes in. Although previously mentioned as a red teaming skill set, this proves equally important to the blue teamer in being able to scout the internet, social media, and the dark web for any information that could either pose a threat or aid the threat actor in <span class="No-Break">some way.</span></p>
<p>A good example would be to search the dark web for breach databases where the blue teamer (after taking all necessary precautions to protect themselves) browses the dark web in search <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>of compromised emails or <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) credentials of the company they work for. The blue teamer may also use a site such as Shodan.io, which we will cover later on in this book, to find accessible devices from an external perspective, such as external access to firewalls, servers, and CCTV cameras. All of the preceding scenarios aid the blue teamer in developing what is known as a threat profile, which, while not directly focusing on internal and external assets, will still <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>compile potential threats and even <strong class="bold">Indicators of Compromise</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoC</strong>) <span class="No-Break">found externally.</span></p>
<p>A great free resource for learning OSINT is TCM Academy’s free 4-hour course on YouTube, which can be found <span class="No-Break">here </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwA6MmbeGNo"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwA6MmbeGNo</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Although many of the previously mentioned skills are learned via research and countless hours digging, looking at YouTube videos, and attending specialized courses. I’ve listed just a few certifications that may assist in furthering your studies and career in blue teaming <span class="No-Break">and DFIR.</span></p>
<p>Some blue teaming <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>certifications include (but are not <span class="No-Break">limited to):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator</strong> (<strong class="bold">CHFI</strong>) <span class="No-Break">from </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/></span><span class="No-Break">EC-Council</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Certified Cloud Security Engineer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCSE</strong>) <span class="No-Break">from </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker041"/></span><span class="No-Break">EC-Council</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Certified Forensic Computer Examiner</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFEC</strong>) <span class="No-Break">from </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker042"/></span><span class="No-Break">IACIS</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">GIAC Certified Forensics Examiner</strong> (<strong class="bold">GFCE</strong>) <span class="No-Break">from </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/></span><span class="No-Break">SANS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We will look at the tools required to be a DFIR investigator and analyst in more detail throughout this book. Although we won’t be going into detail about commercial tools used, I will mention some that you may wish to look into at some point if heading into a career in DFIR or as a blue teamer, although the open source tools covered in this book are more than enough to get you started and conduct entire DFIR investigations as long as the best practices and procedures <span class="No-Break">are followed.</span></p>
<p>It is also of <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>paramount importance that DFIR investigators and analysts understand the importance of following best practices and procedures in evidence collection, acquisition, analysis, and documentation, as the integrity of the evidence and case could be easily compromised. Analysis of evidence and results in reports should also be repeatable, meaning that other DFIR investigators and analysts should be able to repeat the tests performed and produce the same results <span class="No-Break">as you.</span></p>
<p>In this regard, blue teamers should have a detailed and well-documented plan of action along with knowledge of purpose-specific tools. There are many freely available and well-documented best practices and frameworks for blue teams, some of which we’ll look at in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
<p>Let’s briefly look at an overview of the tools you may be required to use in a DFIR investigation, which are all covered in this book. The following list gives a one-liner for a specific task and the tools used to achieve the task. Think of this as a blue team cheat sheet where open source tools are concerned.

<p>Next, let’s have a look at <span class="No-Break">purple teaming.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Understanding purple teaming</h1>
<p>We can now have our cybersecurity moment of Zen as we get into purple teaming. The term <strong class="bold">purple teaming</strong> refers to the combination of skill sets in red and blue teaming. The color purple can <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>also be achieved by mixing the colors red and blue, hence the name purple teaming. Looking back at all the skill sets and certifications mentioned in the red and blue teaming sections, it may seem like an impossible accomplishment; however, I guarantee you that there are many purple teamers out there who started as novices and ended up as professionals, <span class="No-Break">myself included.</span></p>
<p>When I started my journey in cybersecurity in the early 2000s, I was far more interested in ethical hacking and pentesting (red teaming) at that point in time and spent many a night in front of my desktop reading, researching, and using the very limited tools available at that time. It was not until perhaps 2008 that I decided to get into DFIR and became very interested in the field of forensics, to the point where I started to teach the CHFI course alongside the <span class="No-Break">CEH course.</span></p>
<p>Every time I thought to myself that I’d specialize in one, I’d come across a new tool that would point me in the direction of the other. Thankfully, this all worked out in my favor as I soon realized that red and blue teaming overlap in many aspects and also that there was never a point where I could say that what I had already learned was enough. My point here is that cybersecurity is such a dynamic field with so many paths that you can never know just enough. There is always some new exploit, an investigative tool, or an incident response procedure to learn, and it’s up to you to decide whether you would like to specialize in one field or continue to learn and grow as I did and apply your knowledge <span class="No-Break">when necessary.</span></p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and I’m the owner of the Computer Forensics and Security Institute, where I not only lead a purple team but I’m also the lead penetration tester as well as the lead forensic and incident response investigator. Again, it is very much possible to be well versed in both fields once you commit <span class="No-Break">to it.</span></p>
<p>In this regard, I can comfortably state that Kali Linux is the perfect place to get started, as it offers the best tools for purple teaming. Let’s have a sneak peek at some of the exploitation (red teaming tools) available to us, which are all preinstalled with any version <span class="No-Break">of Kali.</span></p>
<p>This is just a snippet of the tools within the <strong class="bold">Exploitation</strong> menu of Kali; however, I use the <strong class="bold">metasploit framework</strong>, the <strong class="bold">msf payload creator</strong>, and the <strong class="bold">social engineering toolkit (root)</strong> religiously <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>for red <span class="No-Break">team assessments.</span></p>

<p>Now let’s have a look at the <strong class="bold">Forensic</strong> menu in <span class="No-Break">Kali Linux:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – Tools within the Forensics menu</p>
<p>Again, these are just <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>some of the forensics tools, as the others can also be found by viewing the <strong class="bold">All Applications</strong> menu, which we will explore in <a href="B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Kali Linux</em>. Kali Linux is one of the few user-friendly platforms that offers a variety of tools for purple teaming, and I look forward to showing you how to effectively use many of them in the <span class="No-Break">coming chapters.</span></p>
<p>In <a href="B19441_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Kali Linux</em>, I’ll show you, step by step, how to set up Kali Linux in a safe, virtual test environment where we can use our tools and download sample files for analysis. Although this virtual machine will be connected to the internet, we will use it in a sandboxed environment to ensure that it does not affect your production environment. In <a href="B19441_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Installing Wine in Kali Linux</em>, I will also walk you through the process of installing Wine in Kali Linux to help build your ultimate blue and purple team arsenal of tools that will now combine the best open source Windows and <span class="No-Break">Linux tools.</span></p>
<p>Now that we’ve looked <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>at the differences between red, blue, and purple teaming, we will be moving on to understand digital forensics and also have a look at other forensic platforms and some commercial tools and quite importantly, gain some insight into forensic frameworks in <a href="B19441_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Digital Forensics</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we were introduced to Kali Linux’s Debian-based operating system and its usefulness in the world of cybersecurity. We also learned about the different teams in cybersecurity, such as red teams, comprised of individuals concerned with offensive security and ethical hacking, such as penetration testers, and blue teams, comprised of individuals concerned with defending networks and data, such as forensic investigators. We also learned that having both red and blue teaming skill sets and experience puts an individual into the highly skilled purple team, which suggests that the individual is versed in a wide range of tools for vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and also incident response and digital forensics, many of which can be found in <span class="No-Break">Kali Linux.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will dive a bit deeper into digital forensics, look at other forensic operating systems, and learn about forensic frameworks and commonly used open source and commercial tools. See you in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter!</span></p>
