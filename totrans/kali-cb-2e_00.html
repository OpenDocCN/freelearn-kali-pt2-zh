<p class="mce-root">Kali Linux, the most popular security testing platform available today, provides a means for individuals from all walks of life to become more experienced with penetration testing and information security. Kali is not only the cornerstone of many security penetration testing programs, but also has a tremendous community of users who share code, methods, and experiences to help even the most seasoned security practitioners become more effective. As a platform, Kali Linux is quite versatile. It can be run from bootable media, installed onto hardware platforms, or run in virtual environments. It can be enhanced with any number of tools available outside of the native distribution (and we will demonstrate this in the following chapters). It truly gives you the means to have a single platform to work from, in any format you like, without the need for expensive investments in hardware and software.</p>
<p class="mce-root">With the rise of malicious actors and malware, and the increased focus on system and network security, being able to understand how the attacker operates allows you to become more effective at providing balanced and appropriate controls.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this book, we will explore how to use Kali Linux as well as additional tools such as Nexpose, Nessus, and OpenVAS to perform various types of penetration testing tasks. We will cover how to set up an effective lab for testing purposes and we will also cover many aspects of penetration testing, along with useful advice on how to go about being successful in using the Kali Linux platform.</p>

<p><a href="7560c369-51ac-43f6-b94e-3889265b10bc.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Installing Kali and the Lab Setup</em>, documents best practices for setting up a testing environment, where you can test the skills highlighted in this book.</p>
<p><a href="48d70dd4-e446-4efa-9f68-eae64fddd3ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Reconnaissance and Scanning</em>, enables you to learn the skills necessary to gather information about your target environment. We will gather domain names, IP subnets, hosts, routing information, as well as other useful information. You will also learn how to keep track of this data, so we can refer to it in the future as we progress through our penetration testing environment.</p>
<p><a href="efecc8fd-4746-4428-9662-854d418bcba2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Vulnerability Analysis</em>, explains that once access to a network has been gained and the systems within that network have been identified, the next step is to establish a foothold and persistent access.</p>
<p><a href="9f678d15-2115-4e29-a75d-03dba65d3398.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Finding Exploits in the Target</em>, takes the host information that we have accumulated to determine the potential exploits to use against target machines and services.</p>
<p><a href="f6db0321-3c3e-4511-927c-cf279ea1700a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Social Engineering</em>, speaks about social engineering that can be employed through electronic means and is also used in physical penetration testing and even data gathering. We bend well-known natural tendencies to help us accomplish or obtain what we want.</p>
<p><a href="868da5dc-85d4-4ac2-9325-1274b75c8c7d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Password Cracking</em>, enables you to learn different techniques and tools to gain knowledge of password hashes gained during various attacks, as well as the means to reset these passwords if access is gained.</p>
<p><a href="66009beb-61cd-46c3-9233-ec9b8edbf79c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Privilege Escalation</em>, helps you to learn how to use a small foothold to expand the scope of your breach, increase the admin level, and use lateral movement to compromise more machines. In most cases, the initial point of a breach is not the desired target, but just a means to get to the more valuable targets.</p>
<p><a href="86184310-ec3f-4792-a238-a7719e071af2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Wireless Specific Recipes</em>, explains that due to the ever growing adoption of wireless networking, as well as the extended reach wireless signals can provide, we will focus on how to gain access to these networks through a variety of means.</p>
<p><a href="f8114976-00fa-415d-94e7-254206a44dbb.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Web and Database Specific Recipes</em>, explains that evaluating the security of web applications and databases requires a unique set of tools that can be leveraged against them. In the event that a web application is compromised, it is highly likely that it may then be used as a jumping off point for further network penetration.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="02e6452a-b223-4edb-954a-fef51f21215e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Maintaining Access</em>, explains that once access has been gained to the target environment, it is crucial to make sure that your access is maintained. Learn how to maintain access and pivot into other areas of your target environment.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">What you need for this book</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This book assumes a medium level of expertise on Linux operating systems, strong knowledge of networking technologies, including both wired and wireless, moderate experience with OS platform configuration, and moderate experience with general information security concepts. This book will go through the process of setting up a basic testing lab, the installation of Kali Linux, and the tools needed to perform network reconnaissance, and exploitation. Because you will be running exercises against live hosts, it is important that this environment is isolated from other non-test environments.</p>
<p>Kali Linux can be installed into a virtual environment such as VirtualBox or VMware, or can be installed onto a dedicated hardware. This book requires that you have enough compute resources for the Kali Linux installation as well as the target systems. In addition to the minimum requirements for your hypervisor, minimum hardware or virtual requirements are listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: 10 cores</li>
<li>Memory: 24 GB RAM</li>
<li>Disk space: 260 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, you will need the following software list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kali Linux 2017.x</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>Windows XP</li>
<li>Windows 7</li>
<li>Windows 2008</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary additional packages that must be installed onto Kali Linux, depending on the recipe requirements.</p>

<p>To make best use of the content of this book, knowledge in networking, device management, general information security concepts, and core operating systems is required. Foundational knowledge of Kali Linux is also expected. Since Kali Linux provides a tremendous number of tools for many different purposes, it is impossible to cover all possible combinations of the available tools and their use. For more details on all the tools available within Kali Linux, visit the official Kali Linux Tool page located at <a href="https://tools.kali.org/"><span>https://tools.kali.org/</span></a>. With that in mind, this book is intended to provide a more in-depth set of recipes to take advantage of these tools to sharpen your knowledge of security penetration testing and exploitation of insecure/undersecured environments.</p>
