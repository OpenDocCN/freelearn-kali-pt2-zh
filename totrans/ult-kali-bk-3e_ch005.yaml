    automatically generated](../media/file119.png)As an aspiring ethical hacker and
    penetration tester, it’s important to develop your skills and gain a solid understanding
    on how adversaries are able to efficiently discover and collect sensitive information
    about a targeted organization, and analyze the collected data to create meaningful
    information that can be leveraged in planning a future cyber-attack on the target.
    As with many aspiring ethical hackers, we are always excited to get started with
    hacking into systems and networks as it’s the fun part of learning offensive security
    tactics and techniques. However, it’s important to develop the mindset of an adversary
    to better understanding why and how a real threat actor will plan their attack
    on a targeted system, network or organization.Adversaries use various reconnaissance
    techniques and procedures to find and collect data about their targets to better
    understand whether the targeted systems are online, whether any security vulnerabilities
    exists on them, and which attack vectors and infrastructure are available for
    delivering malicious payloads to the target. The more information that’s known
    about the target can improve how the plan of attack by the adversary.In this chapter,
    you will learn how reconnaissance techniques are used by threat actors and ethical
    hackers to discover, collect and analyze sensitive data that’s leaked by the targeted
    organization, and how such data can lead to a future cyber-attack. In addition,
    you will learn how to conceal your identity as an ethical hacker and penetration
    tester, and anonymize your internet-based traffic to improve your stealth and
    reduce your threat level.In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:'

    then analyzing the collected data to create meaningful information that can be
    leveraged by an adversary or threat actor to identify the attack surface and security
    vulnerabilities on a targeted system, network or organization. Adversaries uses
    various reconnaissance techniques and tools to collect system information, networking
    information and organizational information about their targets. Without first
    understanding your target and their weaknesses, it’ll be challenging to create
    a weapon such as an *exploit* that will be effective in compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity and/or availability of the targeted system, network or organization.System
    information provides valuable insights to ethical hackers as it lets us know what’s
    running on the targeted system, such as it host operating system and version.
    The operating system and version information helps ethical hackers to research
    known security vulnerabilities and develop/acquire exploits that has the potential
    to compromise the target. For instance, many organizations around the world does
    not always run the latest version of operating systems within their network infrastructure
    While operating system vendors are continuously working on a newer version and
    releasing security updates to customers, not everyone installs the latest security
    patches/updates or even upgrade to the latest version for many reasons. This situation
    creates many possibilities for adversaries, ethical hackers and penetration testers.
    Imagine you’re performing an internal network penetration test on a targeted organization
    and have discovered their servers are running an older version of Microsoft Windows
    Server, and after some research, you’ve discovered all the servers contains the
    *EternalBlue* and *PrintNightmare* critical security vulnerabilities. If a real
    adversary were to discover these vulnerabilities, you can imagine the potential
    impact and damages that can be done.System information includes the following

    hacker and penetration tester, whereby reducing the likelihood of triggering any
    alerts which notifies the target that someone is collecting information about
    them, their systems and network infrastructure.Each day, more data is being uploaded
    and created on the internet by people around the world. Whether someone is uploading
    a picture of themselves, a fun marketing video or even information about new products
    and services for new and existing customers, the internet is storing lots of data
    which can be harvested and carefully analyzed by cyber criminals to better understand
    their targets and improve their cyber operations. As previously mentioned, ethical

    However, it’s important to collect all the information during the reconnaissance
    phase, then analyze the collected data to determine what is useful and helps you
    build a profile of your target. To get a better understanding on how adversaries,
    ethical hackers and penetration testers uses passive reconnaissance to identify
    sensitive information and security vulnerabilities on targets, let’s take a deep

    and analysis of publicly available information from multiple data sources to better
    understand the attack surface such as the security vulnerabilities on a targeted
    organization. In addition, OSINT helps ethical hackers and penetration testers
    to identify how their targets are leaking sensitive data which can be leveraged
    by threat actors to improve their cyber-attacks and threats.As more organizations
    are creating an online presence on the internet, from spinning up virtual servers
    to hosting their web applications on cloud computing service providers’ infrastructure,
    many companies are using social media platforms to create awareness and share
    information with new and existing customers. While social media platforms enables
    people around the world to share updates, pictures and videos to each other using
    a digital medium, sometimes people leak sensitive information about themselves
    or their organizations without realizing the potential risk if the information
    were to be leveraged by a cyber-criminal. For instance, an employee shares a digital
    photograph of themselves while at their workstation, however the background of
    the image shows some confidential documents on their desk, their employee’s ID
    badge and some applications on their computer’s monitor. If a threat actor is
    targeting the company, the attacker will use passive reconnaissance to identify
    the social media presence of the targeted organization such as their LinkedIn,
    Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages. Sometimes, organizations will post on social
    media about new job vacancies with the technical requirements for a potential
    candidate. Threat actors can leverage the technical details found within a job
    post to determine the technologies and applications that are running within the
    organization’s network.Furthermore, the threat actor can identify the social media
    accounts of past and present employees to determine if anyone has uploaded a picture
    with sensitive details. Social media platforms provides a lot of privacy features
    to their users, however, not everyone takes the extra times to ensure their online
    profiles are private and visible to online trusted contacts. If a threat actor
    is able to find an employee’s social media accounts with unsecure privacy settings
    and their pictures are all publicly available. The threat actor can simply looks
    for pictures that contains the employee’s ID badge which can be used to create
    a fake badge to gain unauthorized physical access to the compound, and even determine
    what applications are running on the employee’s computer. Identifying the applications
    on the targeted systems helps the threat actor to research security vulnerabilities
    for the operating system and applications on the computers.While there’s a lot
    of sensitive information which can be found on social media platforms, there are
    addition OSINT data sources, such as the following:'

    which are commonly used by the tech community to help and share ideas with each
    other. However, technical employees may create a profile on a discussion forum
    and include their job title and company name. A threat actor can search for users’
    profiles that are associated with the targeted organization, then the attacker
    can view all the posts and discussions made by the employees to identify any sensitive
    information that may be leaked. For instance, the employees may create a discussion
    post on requesting help for a specific application on their network and reveals
    the application version, error logs and host operating system for a server. The
    threat actor can leverage this information to research known security vulnerabilities

    plan a cyber-attack.Once the ethical hacker determines the scope of the security
    assessment, the ethical hacker will proceed to *data collection and retrieval*
    of OSINT on the targeted organization. This means, the ethical hacker will use
    reconnaissance TTPs to collect multiple data types such as text, media and geo-spatial
    data from multiple data sources on the internet to create a profile about the
    target. During this phase, it’s important for both ethical hackers and penetration

    but in a different area to better understand and improve the profile of the target.
    For instance, the ethical hacker may attempt to determine the organizational hierarchy
    of employees, and perform social media OSINT to identify all employees with a
    social media profile to investigate what type of information each person is leaking
    about the company. Discovering the social media accounts of employees can lead
    to discovering the IT professionals who are employed by the targeted organization,
    and identify whether they made any recent social media post about their technical
    work in the organizations.Once sufficient data is analyzed about the target, the
    ethical hacker and penetration tester creates intelligence that will assist in
    planning for the *weaponization*, *delivery* and *exploitation* phase to compromise
    the target. However, active reconnaissance techniques and procedures are needed
    to collect sensitive information that’s not available from OSINT. Having completed
    this section, you have learnt about the importance of passive information gathering
    and how OSINT can be leveraged by ethical hackers and penetration testers to identify
    security flaws on a targeted system, network and organization. In the next section,
    you will learn how to conceal your online identity as an aspiring ethical hacker.

    and penetration testers to gather information about their target various sources
    on the internet. When using OSINT strategies and techniques, you’ll need to ensure
    you do not make direct contact with the targeted organization and that your real
    identity is not revealed during the process. A **sock puppet** is a terminology
    that's used within the cybersecurity industry, especially among penetration testers.
    A sock puppet is simply a misrepresentation of an individual, such as creating
    an entire fake identity or persona with the intent to infiltrate an online community
    to gather information. While pretending to be someone else is unlawful, hackers
    always create a fake identity on the internet when gathering information about
    their targets. By creating a fake persona on an online platform such as a social
    media website, no one knows the true identity of the account owner. Therefore,
    the hacker can pretend to be an employee or a mutual friend of their target to
    gather data about the organization.

    when performing any type of intelligence gathering about their targets. This technique
    is used to prevent the target, such as an organization or person, from determining
    the true identity of the penetration tester who is collecting data about them.
    If the organization hires a penetration tester to simulate a real-world cyber-attack,
    and the penetration tester is using their real online accounts to gather intelligence,
    their true identity may be revealed. Some social media platforms such as LinkedIn
    allow a user to see who has visited their profile recently. If the penetration
    tester uses their real account to investigate an employee''s profile, this may
    trigger a red flag for the organization. Another key aspect of using a sock puppet
    is to ensure the target does not know who is performing the OSINT investigation.
    This is also a good practice for penetration testers to remain stealthy during
    a security assessment.When creating a sock puppet, ensure the profile looks very
    legitimate and believable to anyone who views it. The following are some resources

    When the encrypted packet arrives at the first-node within the TOR network, the
    first-node decrypts the first layer of encryption to determine how to forward
    the packet to the next node. When the packet arrives at the second-node, it decrypts
    another layer and the process is repeated until the packet arrives at the exit-
    or last node within the TOR network. The exit-node will perform the final decryption
    to determine the true destination IP address of the packet and forwards it towards
    the destination host on the internet/dark web.Therefore, the destination host
