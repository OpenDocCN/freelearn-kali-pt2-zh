- en: Nowadays, information security is a hot topic all over the news and the internet.
    We hear almost every day about web page defacement, data leaks of millions of
    user accounts and passwords or credit card numbers from websites, and identity
    theft on social networks. Terms such as cyberattack, cybercrime, hacker, and even
    cyberwar are becoming part of the daily lexicon in the media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All this exposure to information security subjects and the very real need to
    protect both sensitive data and their reputations has made organizations more
    aware of the need to know where their systems are vulnerable, especially ones
    that are accessible to the world through the internet, how they could be attacked,
    and what the consequences would be in terms of information lost or systems being
    compromised if an attack were successful. Also, much more importantly, how to
    fix those vulnerabilities and minimize the risks.

- en: The task of detecting vulnerabilities and discovering their impact on organizations
    can be addressed with penetration testing. A penetration test is an attack, or
    attacks, made by a trained security professional who uses the same techniques
    and tools real hackers use, to discover all of the possible weak spots in an organization's
    systems. Those weak spots are then exploited and the impact is measured. When
    the test is finished, the penetration tester reports all of their findings and
    suggests how future damage could be prevented.

- en: In this book, we follow the whole path of a web application penetration test
    and, in the form of easy-to-follow, step-by-step recipes, show how the vulnerabilities
    in web applications and web servers can be discovered, exploited, and fixed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have tried to write this book with many kinds of readers in mind. Firstly,
    computer science students, developers, and systems administrators who want to
    take their information security knowledge one step further or want to pursue a
    career in the field will find some very easy-to-follow recipes here that will
    allow them to perform their first penetration test in their own testing laboratory,
    and will also give them the basis and tools to continue practicing and learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Application developers and systems administrators will also learn how attackers
    behave in the real world, what steps can be followed to build more secure applications
    and systems, and how to detect malicious behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, seasoned security professionals will find some intermediate and advanced
    exploitation techniques, and ideas on how to combine two or more vulnerabilities
    in order to perform a more sophisticated attack.

    testers to attack their servers and applications with the goal of knowing what''s

    of penetration testing by giving simple and direct guidelines on what to do to
    fix and prevent the most critical web application vulnerabilities according to
