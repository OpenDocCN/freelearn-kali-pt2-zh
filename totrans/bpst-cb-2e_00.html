			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Burp Suite is a Java-based platform for testing the security of your web applications and has been adopted widely by professional <span class="No-Break">enterprise testers.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Open Web Application Security Project</strong> (<strong class="bold">OWASP</strong>) offers many resources to developers and testers for securing web and API applications. This book leverages test cases from OWASP with slight modifications for use in Burp Suite to give you hands-on practice. Toward the end of this book, more advanced concepts are included, giving you recipes to be applied in bug bounty hunting, penetration testing, and <span class="No-Break">application security.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you will be up and running with using Burp Suite to test the security posture of your web applications <span class="No-Break">and APIs.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/></p>
