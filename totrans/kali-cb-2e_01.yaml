    setup and some of the considerations that we will take when using the lab. Some
    of these considerations are designed to make the lab more effective, while others
    are used for the protection of the networks our lab is connected to. We also want

- en: Today, there are many different hypervisors that will allow you to run multiple
    virtual machines on a single physical machine. For our specific purposes, we have
    chosen to show you how to setup the initial lab in VirtualBox due to several compelling
    factors. It's free to use, has multi-platform support, and it's able to run within
    your main operating system. However, as we progress past the first chapter, we
    will be switching to VMware ESXi. This will not affect recipes in any way between
    using VirtualBox and VMware ESXi. Our main reason for switching is the amount
    of compute resources that are available to us in our dedicated lab. We have the
    ability to run many virtual machines at once, and we will have the ability to
    insert firewalls and other security devices between our Kali instance and our
    testing hosts, as needed. We also have the flexibility to create more complex
    environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, for any reason, you are looking to build a larger test network or have a
    different hypervisor of choice that better suits your purposes, feel free to use
    it, as we will assume you will be able to translate our instructions between the
    different hypervisors.

    network and a host-only network. Our Kali box will be connected to both the networks,
    so it can communicate with devices on the internet, download updates, and get
    software packages as needed. Our target machines will only be connected to the
    host-only network. The host-only network can only talk within the host and among
    other devices connected to the host-only network. It cannot communicate through
    your Ethernet or wireless networks. This setup is extremely critical to our testing
    environment, as we do not ever want to expose our testing hosts to the outside
    world, as they are very vulnerable and will be hacked rather quickly.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To further protect the networks that your lab is connected to, we would actually
    suggest disconnecting the virtual adapter of the Kali virtual machine that connects
    to the NAT network, unless specifically required for the recipe operation. This
    way, your network is protected from accidental exposures to any attacks you may
    be sourcing from Kali.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the many questions frequently asked is why we soften machines or use
    machines that have vulnerabilities. The fact is that a properly patched, properly
    configured, and properly hardened machine is quite difficult to get into. Penetration
    testing is not trying to get through to hardened devices but looking specifically
    for those devices that have vulnerabilities. In a typical engagement, you may
    find only one or two machines that have vulnerabilities. You can then use these
    machines to gain a foothold into an environment to compromise other more hardened
    machines. If you start doing regular engagements as a penetration tester, you
    will be surprised by just how many machines you may be able to find that have
    vulnerabilities. This is especially true with the proliferation of low cost **Internet
    of Things** (**IoT**) devices such as internet connected cameras, thermostats,
    automation systems, and monitoring. These devices often run Linux-type embedded
    operating systems and are rarely patched and often overlooked. More importantly,
    they are often riddled with bugs and vulnerabilities that we can use for our purposes.

    the same general principles will apply.

- en: When it comes to learning a new set of skills or sharpening the ones you already
    have, the importance of a testing environment cannot be overstated. It is imperative
    that you have the means to test against systems in a known state so that you can
    validate the results of your tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One method of saving resources, both physical hardware and computing resources,
    is to utilize a virtual environment where your testing devices reside. One very
    popular example of a virtualization platform is Oracle's VirtualBox—a purpose
    build virtualization environment designed for use with x86 platforms that can
    host many virtual machines on one physical computer. This allows for the sharing
    of resources such as disk, RAM, CPU, and so on. Additionally, because VirtualBox
    supports importing and exporting virtual appliances, resources can be easily moved,
    shared, and so on.
