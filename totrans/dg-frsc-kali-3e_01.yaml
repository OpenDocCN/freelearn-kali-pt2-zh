- en: As we begin our journey into **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** (**DFIR**),
    it is important that we have a clear understanding of Blue and Purple Teaming,
    which is compared to Red Teaming, and also have a firm grasp on fundamental knowledge
    required to create a Blue and Purple Teaming lab environment. This section explains
    the terminology and looks at the skillsets required in becoming a Blue and Purple
    Teamer, and also demonstrates various methods of setting up a DFIR lab environment.
