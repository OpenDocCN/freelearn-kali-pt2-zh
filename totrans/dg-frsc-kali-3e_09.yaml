    at the very start of an investigation when all the facts on what occurred may
    not have yet been collected or stated. As in any investigation, we should be aware
    of and follow the guidelines, practices, and procedures for acquiring evidence
    in such a way that it is not tampered with or, in a worst-case scenario, lost.

- en: At the scene of a crime, let’s say a shooting, there are specific items that
    may immediately qualify as evidence. The physical evidence is easily collected,
    put into evidence bags, labeled, and then shipped off to the labs and secure storage
    areas for safekeeping. This evidence may include spent bullet casings, perhaps
    a gun, fingerprints, and blood samples. Let’s not forget witness statements and
    **Closed Circuit Television** (**CCTV**) footage too. It’s also of interest to
    consider the individuals from law enforcement agencies that would be at the scene
    and the order in which they may have arrived. Seems simple enough.

    of the data and *not* on the original data or evidence, as working on original
    evidence can, and usually will, modify the contents of the medium. For instance,
    booting a seized laptop into its native operating system will allow data to be
    written to the hard drive and may also erase and modify contents contained in
    the RAM and paging file.
  prefs: []

    Write blockers, as the name suggests, prevent data from being written to the evidence
    media. Write blockers can be found in both hardware and software types. If a hardware
    write blocker is not available, software versions are readily available as standalone
    features in forensic operating systems including C.A.I.N.E, as mentioned in [*Chapter

- en: Creating a copy of each bit of data exactly as is, is referred to as a **physical
    or forensic image**. Performing a **bitstream copy** ensures the integrity of
    the copy. To further prove this, hashing of the original evidence and the physical
    image is calculated and compared (which we will delve into shortly). If the forensic
    copy is off by even one bit of data, the hash values created by the respective
    algorithms will be quite different.

    the next chapter is **Secure Hashing Algorithm-1** (**SHA1**). SHA1 is more secure
    than MD5 as it produces a 160-bit output instead of a 128-bit output as with MD5\.
    Due to known collision attacks against both MD5 and SHA-1, the safer and more
    robust option for hashing is now **SHA-2**.

    and IT. Added to what we traditionally think of as Information Technology, there
    is now **Operational Technology** (**OT**). OT mainly deals with devices and machinery
    traditionally found in the manufacturing and utility sectors, which may be logically
    managed by IT processes. A good example is **SCADA** (short for **Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition**) systems, which are commonly used by gas and utility
    companies to monitor operational equipment. Disruption to these services could
    affect millions of persons and businesses, and formal incident response procedures

    who, as per protocol, performs the tasks of documenting and securing the scene
