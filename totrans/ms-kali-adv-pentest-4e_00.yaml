- en: This book is about the use of Kali Linux in performing penetration tests against
    networks, systems, and applications. A penetration test simulates an attack against
    a network or a system by a malicious outsider or insider. Unlike a vulnerability
    assessment, penetration testing is designed to include the exploitation phase.
    Therefore, it proves that the exploit is present and that the system is at risk
    of being compromised if not acted upon.

    and *hackers* interchangeably as they use the same techniques and tools to assess
    the security of networks and data systems. The only difference between them is
    their end objective—infiltrating a secure data network or a data breach.

    with many proven techniques to defeat the latest defenses on a network using Kali
    Linux. From selecting the most effective tools, to rapidly compromising network
    security to highlighting the techniques used to avoid detection.

- en: If you’re a penetration tester, IT professional, or security consultant who
    wants to maximize the success of your network testing using some of the advanced
    features of Kali Linux, then this book is for you. Some prior exposure to the
    basics of penetration testing/ethical hacking would be helpful to get the most
    out of this title.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Goal-Based Penetration Testing*, introduces a functional outline
    based on the penetration testing methodology that will be used throughout the
    book. It ensures that a coherent and comprehensive approach to penetration testing
    will be followed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Open-Source Intelligence and Passive Reconnaissance*, provides
    a background on how to gather information about a target using publicly available
    sources and the tools that can simplify reconnaissance and information management.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Active Reconnaissance of External and Internal Networks*, introduces
    the reader to stealthy approaches that can be used to gain information about the
    target, especially the information that identifies vulnerabilities, which could
    be exploited.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Vulnerability Assessment*, teaches you the semi-automated process
    of scanning a network and its devices to locate systems that are vulnerable to
    attack and compromise and the process of taking all reconnaissance and vulnerability
    scan information, assessing it, and then creating a map to guide the penetration
    testing process.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Advanced Social Engineering and Physical Security*, shows you
    why being able to physically access a system or interact with the humans who manage
    it provides the most successful route to exploitation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Wireless and Bluetooth Attacks*, provides a brief explanation
    of wireless and Bluetooth technologies and focuses on the common techniques used
    to compromise these networks by bypassing security.'

    of one of the most complex delivery phases to secure: web-based applications that
    are exposed to the public internet.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Cloud Security Exploitation*, focuses on attacks against AWS
    cloud infrastructure, which are frequently prone to security misconfigurations
    and are protected to the same degree as the organization’s primary network.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Bypassing Security Controls*, demonstrates the most common security
    controls in place, identifies a systematic process for overcoming these controls,
    and demonstrates this using the tools from the Kali toolset.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Exploitation*, demonstrates the methodologies that can be used
    to find and execute exploits that allow a system to be compromised by an attacker.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Action on the Objective and Lateral Movement*, focuses on the
    immediate post-exploit activities, as well as the aspect of horizontal escalation
    – the process of using an exploited system as a starting point to “jump off” to
    other systems on the network.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Privilege Escalations*, teaches the penetration tester to own
    all aspects of a system’s operations; more importantly, obtaining some access
    privileges that allow the tester to control all the systems across a network.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Command and Control*, focuses on what a modern attacker would
    do to enable data to be exfiltrated to the attacker’s location and hide the evidence
    of the attack.'

- en: '*Chapter 14*, *Embedded Devices and RFID hacking,* focuses on what a modern
    attacker would do to perform a structured attack on embedded devices and clone

    its suite of tools. To ensure that it is up-to-date and that you have all of the
    tools, you will need access to an internet connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sadly, not all of the tools on the Kali Linux system will be addressed since
    there are too many of them. The focus of this book is not to overwhelm you with
    all of the tools and options but to provide an approach for testing that will
    allow you to learn and incorporate new tools as their experiences and knowledge
    change over time.

    methodology and most of the tools are transferrable to other operating systems

    systems. You will need a target operating system. Many of the examples in the
    book use Microsoft Windows 2016, Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.04, and Windows 2008 R2\.
