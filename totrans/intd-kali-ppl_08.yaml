- en: In this part, you’ll learn what to do with the data that you’ve collected, enriched,
    indexed, and stored through traffic and log analysis. This will be accomplished
    through the Malcolm suite of data collection and analysis tools, with a particular
    focus on Arkime along with StrangeBee’s Cortex and TheHive SOAR. You will examine
    the differences between intrusion detection and intrusion prevention and get your
    hands dirty playing with Suricata and Zeek IDSs/IPSs.
