- en: In this part, we look at one of the most popular and powerful open source tools
    used by DFIR investigators and analysts, called Autopsy. Autopsy is available
    for both Linux and Windows, and although we previously covered only the Linux
    version in past editions of this book, I am absolutely delighted to show you how
    to get the more powerful Windows version up and running in Kali Linux using Wine
    in this version.
