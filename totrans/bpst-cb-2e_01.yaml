    Community version contains some forced throttling of threads when using the Burp
    Suite Intruder functionality. There are no built-in payloads in the Community
    version, though you can load custom ones. And, finally, several Burp Suite extensions

    edition.

- en: Penetration testers use intercepting proxies to capture traffic flowing between
    a web browser and a web application for analysis and manipulation. For example,
    a tester can pause any HTTP request, thus allowing parameter tampering before
    the request is sent to the web server.

- en: Intercepting proxies, such as Burp, allow testers to intercept both HTTP requests
    and HTTP responses. This allows a tester to observe the behavior of the web application
    under different conditions. And, as we shall see, sometimes the behaviors are
    unintended, deviating from what the original developer expected.

- en: To see Burp Suite in action, you need to configure your Firefox browser’s **Network
    Settings** so that they point to your running instance of Burp. This enables Burp
    to capture all HTTP traffic that is flowing between your browser and the target
    web application.

    flowing between the browser and the OWASP BWA VM. This will allow the proxy service
    within Burp to capture traffic for testing purposes.

    We will step through this process in this recipe.
