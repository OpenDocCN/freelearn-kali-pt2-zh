  zh: 前言
- en: Wireless networks have become ubiquitous in today's world. Millions of people
    use it worldwide every day at their homes, offices, and public hotspots to log
    on to the internet and do both personal and professional work. Even though wireless
    makes life incredibly easy and gives us such great mobility, it comes with its
    risks. In recent times, insecure wireless networks have been used to break into
    companies, banks, and government organizations. The frequency of these attacks
    is only intensified, as network administrators are still clueless on how to secure
    wireless networks in a robust and fool proof way.

    is aimed at helping the reader understand the insecurities associated with wireless
    networks, and how to conduct penetration tests to find and plug them. This is
    an essential read for those who would like to conduct security audits on wireless
    networks and always wanted a step-by-step practical guide for this. With this
    book, your learning will be complete, as every wireless attack explained is immediately
    followed by a practical demo.'

    shows how to create a wireless testing lab using off-the-shelf hardware and open
    source software. In order to be able to try out the dozens of exercises in this
    book, you will need to set up a wireless lab. We will first look at the hardware
    requirements, which include wireless cards, antennas, access points, and other
    Wi-Fi enabled devices. Then we will shift our focus to the software requirements,
    which include the operating system, Wi-Fi drivers, and security tools. Finally,
    we will create a test bed for our experiments and verify the different wireless
    configurations on it.'

    and Its Inherent Insecurities*, focuses on inherent design flaws in wireless networks
    that make insecure out of the box. We will begin with a quick recap of the 802.11
    WLAN protocols using a network analyzer called Wireshark. This will give us a
    practical understanding about how these protocols work. Most importantly, we will
    see how client and access point communication work at the packer level by analyzing
    management, control, and data frames. We will then learn about packet injection
    and packer sniffing in wireless networks, and look at some tools that enable us
    to do this.'

    WLAN协议。这将使我们对这些协议的工作原理有一个实际的了解。最重要的是，我们将通过分析管理帧、控制帧和数据帧，看到客户端与接入点之间的通信如何在数据包层面上运作。然后，我们将学习如何进行数据包注入和数据包嗅探，并探讨一些能够帮助我们实现这些功能的工具。'

    Key Authentication. While doing this, you will learn how to analyze wireless packets
    and figure out the authentication mechanism of the network. We will also look
    at how to break into networks with Hidden SSID and MAC Filtering enabled. These
    are two common mechanisms employed by network administrators to make wireless
    networks more stealthy and difficult to penetrate, however, these are extremely
    simple to bypass.'

    is the encryption schemas—WEP, WPA, and WPA2\. Over the past decade, hackers have
    found multiple flaws in these schemas and have written publically available software
    to break them and decrypt the data. Also, even though WPA/WPA2 are secure by design,
    misconfiguring these opens up security vulnerabilities, which can be easily exploited.

    ones, and finally, discusses bleeding edge attacks and research. As all attacks
    are explained using practical demonstrations, it is very easy for readers at all
    levels to quickly try out the attacks by themselves. Please note that even though
    the book highlights the different attacks that can be launched against a wireless
    network, the real purpose is to educate the user to become a wireless penetration
    tester. An adept penetration tester will understand all the attacks here and will
    be able to demonstrate them with ease, if requested by his client.
