- en: Wireless networks have become ubiquitous in today's world. Millions of people
    use it worldwide every day at their homes, offices, and public hotspots to log
    on to the internet and do both personal and professional work. Even though wireless
    makes life incredibly easy and gives us such great mobility, it comes with its
    risks. In recent times, insecure wireless networks have been used to break into
    companies, banks, and government organizations. The frequency of these attacks
    is only intensified, as network administrators are still clueless on how to secure
    wireless networks in a robust and fool proof way.

- en: '*Kali Linux Wireless Penetration Testing Beginner''s Guide*, *Third Edition*,
    is aimed at helping the reader understand the insecurities associated with wireless
    networks, and how to conduct penetration tests to find and plug them. This is
    an essential read for those who would like to conduct security audits on wireless
    networks and always wanted a step-by-step practical guide for this. With this
    book, your learning will be complete, as every wireless attack explained is immediately
    followed by a practical demo.'

    this book. Kali Linux, as you might already be aware, is the world's most popular
    penetration testing distribution. It contains hundreds of security and hacking
    tools, some of which we will use in this book.

    shows how to create a wireless testing lab using off-the-shelf hardware and open
    source software. In order to be able to try out the dozens of exercises in this
    book, you will need to set up a wireless lab. We will first look at the hardware
    requirements, which include wireless cards, antennas, access points, and other
    Wi-Fi enabled devices. Then we will shift our focus to the software requirements,
    which include the operating system, Wi-Fi drivers, and security tools. Finally,
    we will create a test bed for our experiments and verify the different wireless
    configurations on it.'

    and Its Inherent Insecurities*, focuses on inherent design flaws in wireless networks
    that make insecure out of the box. We will begin with a quick recap of the 802.11
    WLAN protocols using a network analyzer called Wireshark. This will give us a
    practical understanding about how these protocols work. Most importantly, we will
    see how client and access point communication work at the packer level by analyzing
    management, control, and data frames. We will then learn about packet injection
    and packer sniffing in wireless networks, and look at some tools that enable us
    to do this.'

    WLAN Authentication*, reveals how you can break WLAN authentication mechanism!
    We will go step by step, and explore how to subvert Open Authentication and Shared
    Key Authentication. While doing this, you will learn how to analyze wireless packets
    and figure out the authentication mechanism of the network. We will also look
    at how to break into networks with Hidden SSID and MAC Filtering enabled. These
    are two common mechanisms employed by network administrators to make wireless
    networks more stealthy and difficult to penetrate, however, these are extremely
    simple to bypass.'

    Flaws*, describes one of the most vulnerable parts of the WLAN protocol, which
    is the encryption schemas—WEP, WPA, and WPA2\. Over the past decade, hackers have
    found multiple flaws in these schemas and have written publically available software
    to break them and decrypt the data. Also, even though WPA/WPA2 are secure by design,
    misconfiguring these opens up security vulnerabilities, which can be easily exploited.
    In this chapter, you will understand the insecurities in each of these encryption
    schemas, and you''ll perform practical demos on how to break them.'

    on the WLAN Infrastructure*, shifts your focus to WLAN infrastructure vulnerabilities.
    We will look at vulnerabilities created due to both configuration and design problems.
    We will also do practical demos of attacks, namely access point MAC spoofing,
    bit flipping and replay attacks, rogue access points, fuzzing, and denial of service.
    This chapter will you a solid understanding of how to do a penetration test of
    the WLAN infrastructure.'

    might open your eyes if you always believed that wireless client security was
    something you did not have to worry about! Most people exclude the client from
    their list when they think about WLAN security. This chapter will prove beyond
    doubt why the client is just as important as the access point when penetration
    testing a WLAN network. We will look at how to compromise the security using client-side
    attacks such as misassociation, Caffe Latte, disassociation, ad-hoc connections,
    fuzzing, and honeypots.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Advanced WLAN Attacks"), *Advanced WLAN Attacks*,
    looks at more advanced attacks, now that we have already covered most of the basic
    attacks on both the infrastructure and the client. These attacks typically involve
    using multiple basic attacks in conjunction to break security in more challenging
    scenarios. Some of these attacks include wireless device fingerprinting, man-in-the-middle
    over wireless, evading wireless intrusion detection and prevention systems, and
    rogue access point operating using custom protocol. This chapter presents the
    absolute bleeding edge in wireless attacks out in the real world.'

    test in a systematic and methodical way. You will learn about the various phases
    of penetrating testing—Planning, Discovery, Attack, and Reporting, and apply it

- en: To follow and recreate the practical exercises in this book, you will need two
    laptops with built in Wi-Fi cards, a USB wireless Wi-Fi adapter, Kali Linux, and
    some other hardware and software. We have detailed this in [Chapter 1](ch01.html
    "Chapter 1. Wireless Lab Setup"), *Wireless Lab Setup*.

- en: As an alternative to the two laptop setup, you can also create a virtual machine
    housing Kali Linux and connect the card to it using the USB interface. This will
    help you get started with using this book much faster, but we would recommend
    that you use a dedicated machine running Kali Linux for actual assessments in
    the field.

    networks. This includes having prior knowledge about the basics of the 802.11
    protocol and client-access point communication. Though we will briefly touch upon
    some of this when we set up the lab, it is expected that you are already aware
    of these concepts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though this book is a Beginner's series, it is meant for all levels of users,
    from amateurs to wireless security experts. There is something for everyone. The
    book starts with simple attacks and then moves on to explain the more complicated
    ones, and finally, discusses bleeding edge attacks and research. As all attacks
    are explained using practical demonstrations, it is very easy for readers at all
    levels to quickly try out the attacks by themselves. Please note that even though
    the book highlights the different attacks that can be launched against a wireless
    network, the real purpose is to educate the user to become a wireless penetration
    tester. An adept penetration tester will understand all the attacks here and will
    be able to demonstrate them with ease, if requested by his client.
