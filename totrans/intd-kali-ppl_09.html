<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Traffic and Log Analysis</h1>
<p>Now that we’ve established a bare-bones SIEM solution and learned how to direct traffic to that solution, it’s time to see how Kali Purple can help us understand the traffic that we’re sending. Otherwise, it wouldn’t do much good to send the traffic if we couldn’t make much sense of it, right? Kali Purple provides some well-known solutions that each approach traffic analysis <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>in different ways. The two we will highlight are <strong class="bold">Arkime</strong>, formerly known as Moloch, and <strong class="bold">Malcolm</strong>, previously<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> known <span class="No-Break">as Bro.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, we are going to peek at how bad actors will sometimes intentionally manipulate this traffic to fool cyberdefense systems and personnel. Even the most experienced and knowledgeable personnel and systems can be slowed down by making the traffic hard to understand through a concept known as obfuscation. Well-trained bad actors know that obfuscation won’t fool <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>properly trained and/or experienced defense analysts but they will still employ such methods because they know it will, at the very least, annoy and slow down the cyber defenders. That would then potentially buy attackers more time to do their dirty deeds. It’s also worth the effort in their eyes to gamble on the cyber defenders being untrained, poorly trained, or entirely new to the profession, which might sometimes provide them with a <span class="No-Break">lucky strike.</span></p>
<p>Many tools are designed to address obfuscation but anybody who’s been in the cybersecurity profession for a length of time will tell you that there’s one that reigns supreme over the others. It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>called <strong class="bold">CyberChef</strong>, and it too is included in the Kali <span class="No-Break">Purple distribution.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will examine network traffic, packet analysis, and obfuscation by highlighting the features of the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break">Understanding packets</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Malcolm</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Arkime</span></li>
<li>CyberChef <span class="No-Break">and obfuscation</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>The requirements for this chapters are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Minimum requirements</strong>: A computing device with either the <em class="italic">amd64 (x86_64/64-bit)</em> or <em class="italic">i386 (x86/32-bit)</em> architecture. It should contain at least <em class="italic">8 GB</em> <span class="No-Break">of RAM.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Recommended requirements</strong>: Based on feedback from cybersecurity field practitioners, aim for the <em class="italic">amd64 (x86_64/64-bit)</em> architecture with <em class="italic">16 GB</em> of RAM – more is better – and up to <em class="italic">64 GB</em> of additional <span class="No-Break">disk space.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also require a successfully installed and running Elasticsearch instance for the <span class="No-Break">Arkime backend.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Understanding packets</h1>
<p>Those of you with at least a basic knowledge of network transmission know that the information exists as the result of data being <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>broken down into very small measurable chunks, called <strong class="bold">packets</strong>, for easier transmission over the internet. That way, if there is a hiccup of some sort on the internet, only that tiny portion of the total data stream needs to be re-sent, and only if it’s sent with the <strong class="bold">Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">TCP</strong>), which is a protocol that<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> requires the recipient to attempt to reassemble the data <span class="No-Break">in order.</span></p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">User Datagram Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">UDP</strong>) – the default protocol for live streaming – does not require the data to be reassembled in order <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>so that the data can reach its destination in as close to real time from the sender as possible. That’s why sometimes, you’ll see a brief glitch when watching a video. That glitch is from the UDP simply dropping and forgetting the packets with the idea that it’s too late, the show must go on. This information is sent and received through physical portals on endpoint devices. These <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>portals are known as <strong class="bold">network interface </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">cards</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">NICs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>If you currently use a physical cable for your internet connection, you’re probably already familiar with an NIC. It is a term that was originally used to describe the physical portal that’s internal to your computer with an external face that has the physical port in which you plug your cable – called an Ethernet cable – into your device. As time has passed, more and more folks have migrated to wireless internet connections. A wireless NIC is similar in that it has the same function of sending and receiving data. In some cases, this can be a noticeable device with an antenna. As technology improves, wireless NICs, especially in laptop devices, aren’t even <span class="No-Break">noticeable anymore.</span></p>
<p>One interesting thing about NICs is that they are the only element of an information system with a network address that is physically stamped onto the device itself. This is called a <strong class="bold">Media Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">MAC</strong>) address. It is important to understand packets, NICs, and MAC addresses <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>because it is these bits of information that are collected at these locations by network security and other cyber-defense systems and software for analysis and action. Collecting data packets in this manner is aptly known as packet capturing. One<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> of the most famous packet-capturing utilities is known as <strong class="bold">Wireshark</strong> but that’s a tool that hails from the red team side of the Kali<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> Purple family. We will discuss Wireshark in <a href="B21223_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>. For now, we’re going to stick with the utilities that were uniquely added with <span class="No-Break">Kali Purple.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Malcolm</h1>
<p>Malcolm is a free open source tool that focuses on data collection and analysis. It is the result of a collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>between the <strong class="bold">Idaho National Laboratory</strong> and the United States <strong class="bold">Department of Homeland Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">DHS</strong>). More specifically, the contributions come from the <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>somewhat infamous <strong class="bold">Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (<strong class="bold">CISA</strong>), which is an agency within DHS. In this vein, you might <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>be interested to learn that Malcolm is not<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> technically a single piece of software but a collection of many open source tools, including the rest of the tools in both this and the next chapter! If you think about it, that’s what Kali Purple is, right? So, we have a collection of tools within another collection of tools. That should give you an idea of the overall depth of <span class="No-Break">Kali Purple.</span></p>
<p>The idea of Malcolm being a collection of tools can sometimes confuse people because some of these tools are well-known. Two such tools will be covered later in this chapter – Arkime and CyberChef. Two more will be covered in <a href="B21223_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a> – Suricata and Zeek. Zeek is more associated with an IDS type of system and is formerly named Bro, which sometimes causes people to declare that Malcolm used to be Bro. That isn’t true. It is only because it is one of Malcolm’s core utilities. The other tool – Suricata – is also covered in the next chapter. It’s another IDS system that is extremely popular in the open source <span class="No-Break">cyber-defense community.</span></p>
<p>One thing you will discover as we learn about many of the tools within the Kali Purple distribution is that a good majority of them are interoperable or can otherwise integrate with each other, and almost all of them can integrate with the ELK stack – which is why we covered those tools first and in greater detail than the rest. On that note, you will notice that, within the Malcolm distribution, there are some alternatives to Elastic’s Elasticsearch and Kibana. Malcolm offers OpenSearch, which serves as a simultaneous alternative to both ELK <span class="No-Break">stack utilities.</span></p>
<p>Grabbing Malcolm is a little<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> bit different than what we’ve done thus far but it still follows similar concepts. Just remember to research the customization options Malcom offers before you run any <span class="No-Break">configuration scripts.</span></p>
<p>We’re going to use a containerization program called Docker, which we will talk about in-depth in <a href="B21223_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>. For now, we’ll give you the answer key and you can just <span class="No-Break">follow along:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Start your Kali Purple VM and log in to your <span class="No-Break">Purple instance.</span></li>
<li>Open a <span class="No-Break">terminal window.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">apt upgrade</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">gnupg lsb-release</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">y docker.io</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>If you get an error, type <strong class="source-inline">sudo apt install -</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">y docker</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>If you continue to get errors, type <strong class="source-inline">sudo </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">systemctl daemon-reload</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span><p class="list-inset">As a last resort, reboot your system after executing each <span class="No-Break">preceding step.</span></p></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo systemctl enable docker</strong> and then reboot your <span class="No-Break">system again.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo git </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">clone </strong></span><a href="https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>From the root directory, type <strong class="source-inline">sudo chmod -R </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">777 /home/&lt;the_name_you_gave_your_system&gt;/Malcolm/config/dashboards.env</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">cd Malcolm</strong> and then type <strong class="source-inline">sudo chmod -R </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">777 docker-compose.yml</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">cd scripts</strong> and then type <strong class="source-inline">sudo ./</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">configure -d</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span><p class="list-inset">Carefully, observe any errors. If it says an operation is not permitted, this means you need to use <strong class="source-inline">sudo chmod &lt;value&gt;</strong> to change file permissions. We’ve been cheating by using <strong class="source-inline">sudo chmod -R 777</strong> throughout this book because we’re showing you<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> how to create a quick proof-of-concept. In a production environment, however, you will not want to give more permissions than <span class="No-Break">are necessary.</span></p><p class="list-inset">When doing <strong class="source-inline">chmod</strong> for a file, make sure you include the entire file path. Otherwise, you might have correct permissions on the end file but the directories leading to it – if lesser permissions – will still prevent Kali Linux and/or Malcolm from successfully performing <span class="No-Break">the task.</span></p><p class="list-inset">If it says an operation is not permitted, you can usually consider that to be a missing <strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong> command. For example, skipping <strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong> with the preceding <strong class="source-inline">./configure</strong> command could put you through the entire Malcolm configuration process should you also leave <strong class="source-inline">-d</strong> off the end of the command. That would result in a series of configuration questions you’ll need to answer; only after you’re done will it give you the error that the operation is not permitted. When things like that happen, you need to think backward – you must trace your steps and find the first command that you did not place a <strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong> command in <span class="No-Break">front of.</span></p></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">./auth_setup</strong> (this time, it’s best not to use <strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong>) and record the user credentials that you create – you will need them to log in to Malcolm for the <span class="No-Break">first time.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you work through a setup from the Kali command line for Malcolm, the options will be presented along with hints as to the recommended setting by capitalizing Y or N in a yes or no setting or placing the recommendation in parenthesis at the end of the line, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1 – Malcolm ./auth_setup</p>
<p>At this point, you have installed Docker and the core Malcolm engines. Now, it’s time to grab the suite of tools that <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>we will use, as well as allow Malcolm to automatically set up a Docker Compose wrapper for <span class="No-Break">the suite:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>To grab the files you need, type <strong class="source-inline">docker-compose --profile malcolm pull</strong>. You should see the various containers begin to download, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li value="2">You should be prompted to<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> install the <strong class="source-inline">docker-compose</strong> command. Select <em class="italic">Y</em> to <span class="No-Break">install it.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">docker images</strong> to get a confirmed listing of the images that have been pulled <span class="No-Break">into </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">docker-compose</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, all that’s left is to fire it up and start using it! To start Malcolm, you need to remain in the <strong class="source-inline">scripts</strong> directory and type <strong class="source-inline">./start</strong> without using <strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong>. If you like, you can type <strong class="source-inline">ls</strong> to see all of the different options available to you. You can type <strong class="source-inline">./stop</strong> to stop, <strong class="source-inline">./wipe</strong> to wipe the database, or <strong class="source-inline">./restart</strong> to restart. Go ahead and <span class="No-Break">start Malcolm.</span></p>
<p>Make sure you have port <strong class="source-inline">443</strong> forwarded in your VM settings if you’d like to use your host machine to access the interface. Otherwise, you’ll need to operate through the web browser within your VM. Either way, open a web browser and navigate to <a href="https://localhost">https://localhost</a> – there’s no need to append a port number to the end of the URL because the <em class="italic">s</em> in <em class="italic">https</em> tells the browser to use port <strong class="source-inline">443</strong>. The default Malcolm page should load, as seen in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.3</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

<p>Take note of the tiles on the<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> front page for Arkime and CyberChef, both of which will round out <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
<p>The key features of Malcolm are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Packet capture and storage</strong>: Malcolm is designed to capture, store, and analyze network traffic. It relies on tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark – discussed later in this book – to grab the traffic by capturing the packets as they pass through defined <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>network interfaces, as we discussed at the beginning of this chapter. Whatever medium is used to capture the data, it stores the data on disk while providing options for the administrator to configure storage locations, set compression levels for optimization and performance, and even set retention policies for the data. Like nearly every commercially available packet-capturing tool out there, Malcolm utilizes the <strong class="bold">Packet Capture</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCAP</strong>) file format. These types of files will contain metadata and payload data so that analysts can reconstruct the data where needed and gain a detailed analysis. Like Arkime, Malcolm can extract metadata from the packets, reconstruct sessions, index the data, and search it. You can then provide your full analysis of the data by using any of the tools we’ve already covered, such as Elasticsearch and Kibana, CyberChef (we’ll cover this in the next section), the two IDS systems we’ll be looking at in <a href="B21223_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, and <strong class="bold">Snort IDS</strong>. Snort is not part of Kali Purple and is technically no longer a part of Kali Linux at all at the time of writing. This is a crime in some professionals’ opinion but experienced folks <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>would likely be able to still it and make it work. Also of value will be threat feed and<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> information-sharing platforms such as the <strong class="bold">Malware Information Sharing </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Platform</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MISP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Post-event analysis</strong>: Unlike Arkime, there is no inherent support for real-time analysis. Instead, Malcolm’s strength is built around a plethora of tools that are designed to work together to analyze traffic after events occur. You might have already started to piece this together when we talked about the depth of storage and recovery options for PCAP files. Malcolm utilizes metadata extraction and information gathered through IDS systems, which it enriches with data gathered from threat streams if possible. The greatest benefit of Malcom’s post-event<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> analysis, however, is its embedded collaborative analysis design. Through this method, entire security teams can work together by sharing their results through <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Protocol analysis and parsing</strong>: You might be sensing a theme here. Protocol analysis and parsing is a key feature of Malcolm that it accomplishes through its integrations with specialized analysis tools. By that, we mean the tools we’ve been talking about all along, such as IDS/IPS systems. There is support for custom protocol analysis, which has become an unspoken requirement in today’s world of data analysis product development. Occasionally, protocol analysis might also require the benefits of CyberChef and decoding. However, you are more likely to utilize that tool with the data <span class="No-Break">payload itself.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Metadata extraction and indexing</strong>: The platform can extract very rich metadata from the PCAP files that have been captured. It grabs data such as protocol-specific details, payload information, source and destination IP addresses, timestamps, and any other stdout data, depending on the size and type of packet where the extraction is occurring. Grabbing this data gives you a foundation for the post-event analysis we recently covered. It provides insight into network communication <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>patterns and other security types <span class="No-Break">of events.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Threat detection and analysis</strong>: As it relates to threat detection and analysis, Malcolm takes a multi-faceted approach. The various toolsets are used to proactively identify and<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> respond to security threats within network environments. The following methods are the primary means of accomplishing <span class="No-Break">this task:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Rule-based detection</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Pattern matching</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Anomaly detection</span></li><li>Integration with threat feeds – discussed in <span class="No-Break">a moment</span></li><li>Session reconstruction and <span class="No-Break">metadata analysis</span></li><li>Custom rule creation <span class="No-Break">and tuning</span></li><li>Integration with <span class="No-Break">visualization tools</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">Some of these methods will be discussed shortly. Most of them will have a level of overlap with the features of Arkime. For example, we’ve previously discussed rule-based detection. Here, when a set of pre-defined standards is matched, a detection is triggered. These are standards that are usually custom-created by the administrators to look for very specific rules covering very specific potential threats to <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">Pattern matching</strong> is similar to<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> rule-based detection in that it seeks to match patterns of data with rules. The difference is that these are rules that can be a little more generic or else provided by the threat detection engines – the IDS systems we’ve been <span class="No-Break">talking about.</span></p><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">Anomaly detection</strong> is something that occurs after a threat detection engine first grabs a baseline of network behavior to<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> determine what is normal for that environment. Then, when the behavior of network traffic deviates from the established norm, it is considered anomalous and worthy of <span class="No-Break">deeper investigation.</span></p><p class="list-inset"><strong class="bold">Custom rule creation</strong> is not the same as rule-based detection. That is the result of custom rule<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> creation in a literal sense. However, in practice – and this can seem a little <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>perverse and hurt your brain, so don’t feel bad if you need to re-read this section to get a handle on it – it’s a term that’s usually used to extend rule-based detection. Yes, that sounds a lot like the egg laying a chicken. We can’t always control the evolution of terms and tools in practical application. More directly, custom rule creation is a feature that some threat detection engines provide that allows the analyst to take a pre-existing rule, either provided by the engine or a rule-based detection created by the administrator of the environment they are working in, and then make analyst-level customizations to <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>further refine the rule <span class="No-Break">for analysis.</span></p><p class="list-inset">If you’ve ever worked with the completely harmless <strong class="bold">Kusto Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">KQL</strong>), you’ll likely understand<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> this. KQL can be used to manipulate which data is displayed and how it is displayed for deeper analysis without actually changing the storage or values of the data itself. It’s not exactly what custom rule creation is but <span class="No-Break">it’s similar.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Session reconstruction and flow analysis</strong>: Malcolm is very effective at managing session reconstruction and flow analysis. You’ve already gained a solid foundation of the components and methods that are used, so we don’t delve any further. The components can be broken down <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Session reconstruction</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Metadata extraction</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Protocol-specific parsing</span></li><li>Flow analysis and <span class="No-Break">data transfer</span></li><li>Integration with <span class="No-Break">analysis tools</span></li><li>Custom session <span class="No-Break">analysis plugins</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">By all means, take the time to look back at preceding discussions in this chapter with either Malcolm and/or Arkime if you wish to get some reinforcement knowledge of <span class="No-Break">these topics.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data visualization and reporting</strong>: Using the ELK stack, Malcolm provides a robust selection of data visualization and reporting abilities that you can use to facilitate a fully comprehensive analysis and depict network security insights. Kibana integrates with Malcolm and as you already know, you can display data by using charts, graphs, timelines, maps, and countless other methods. Malcolm provides data to Kibana that assists with packet flow visualization. That will assist you, as an analyst, to get a graphical representation of data transfer behaviors, transactional patterns, and network session activities, thus making any irregularities or anomalous behaviors much easier <span class="No-Break">to spot.</span><p class="list-inset">Analysts will also have the ability to generate reports based on the data they are working with using metadata <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>attributes and <strong class="bold">indicators of compromise</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoCs</strong>), among numerous other options. Generating reports can save analysts enormous <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>amounts of time in organizing and providing documentation for <strong class="bold">After Action Reviews</strong> (<strong class="bold">AARs</strong>), communication with stakeholders, and compliance record-keeping <span class="No-Break">and reporting.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Customization and extensibility</strong>: Another key feature of Malcolm is its customization and extensibility. This feature is identical to Arkime’s offerings and is the result of everything we’ve discussed thus far. Feel free to refer to the previous section if <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>you want a deeper explanation. In summary, these offerings are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><ul><li>The ability to create <span class="No-Break">capture plugins</span></li><li>Integration with <span class="No-Break">third-party tools</span></li><li>Custom dashboards and/or other <span class="No-Break">visualization options</span></li><li>Rule-based detection and <span class="No-Break">custom rules</span></li><li>Packet analysis <span class="No-Break">and enrichment</span></li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">User access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">UAC</strong>) <strong class="bold">and collaboration</strong>: UAC and collaboration are supported by the same methods<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> as Arkime. An important concept to pay attention to is <strong class="bold">role-based access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>). It’s easy to mistake a role-based something for a rule-based something. Something that is<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> rule-based, as we covered previously, is something that is based on a set of pre-defined rules. Something that is role-based, however, is when something is based on pre-determined permissions or groups <span class="No-Break">of permissions.</span><p class="list-inset">In the tech world, these groups of pre-determined permissions are called roles. Roles are often set up in <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>advance based on unknown users. Once the role has been set up, users can be added to the group that covers those roles. This means that administrators don’t need to set the permissions for each user individually as they<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> onboard or gain the rights to certain roles. Admins will simply assign that user to the pre-defined group and then all of the privileges and rights are automatically available for that user. Of course, admins can certainly work a user’s rights at an individual level for a finer level of granularity for the user. Collaborative workspaces, data sharing, audit trails, and activity, logs along with user management and provisioning, are all part of Malcom’s UAC and <span class="No-Break">collaboration feature.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Integration with security tools</strong>: In addition to the ELK stack and IDS/IPS tools we’ve covered, Malcolm also integrates seamlessly with a neat network traffic and analysis tool called <strong class="bold">Threat Organized Response with Quantitative and Unified Extensibility</strong> (<strong class="bold">TORQUE</strong>). TORQUE is set apart from other network traffic and<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> analysis tools because of several key differentiators and unique or limited <span class="No-Break">supply characteristics.</span><p class="list-inset">Real-time analysis has gained in popularity and isn’t unique anymore, but it’s worth mentioning that TORQUE was one of the earliest traffic analysis tools to offer results in real time. As you’ve already discovered, real-time analysis means that analysts can examine and respond to network activities as they are <span class="No-Break">actively occurring.</span></p><p class="list-inset">TORQUE offers quantitative analysis features. This enables organizations to perform in-depth quantitative assessments of network traffic patterns, data trends, and communication behaviors. Quantitative analysis is a systematic and structured examination of data using statistics and advanced mathematics to derive insights, identify patterns, and achieve actionable conclusions on data analysis. It can involve calculating and deeply evaluating statistical metrics such as averages, standard deviations, and frequencies, as well as the distribution patterns of network traffic data. It can also involve studying historical trends and behaviors and comparing them with current trends to identify patterns as well as changes in behavior. This assists with <span class="No-Break">anomaly detection.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Risk assessment and <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>capacity planning are important features of TORQUE. Using mathematics, administrators can calculate probabilities along with the potential impact of certain threats by applying the formulas to traffic volume, bandwidth, and resource usage/requirements. That, in turn, can provide the byproduct of performance evaluation, which can help administrators and engineers identify focus areas to address <span class="No-Break">and/or improve.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Alerting and notifications</strong>: One of the most desired features of any cybersecurity defensive product is the ability to receive notifications and alerts. We can develop alerts with the usual suspects of rule-based and anomaly detection alerting. However, Malcolm allows for some additional types <span class="No-Break">of alerting.</span><p class="list-inset">There is threshold alerting, which is when there’s a predefined threshold for a particular metric or behavior within the network traffic data that can be assigned to trigger an alert once the admin or user-defined metric is exceeded. Your network engineers (or yourself) might find this type of alerting handy when you want to monitor and respond to deviations from normal traffic patterns such as sudden spikes in traffic volume or endpoint <span class="No-Break">CPU/RAM usage.</span></p><p class="list-inset">You will able to be able to create customized alerts to check for different manners of delivering alert notifications, such as email, SMS, or integration with one of the other tools or SIEM/SOAR solutions within your SOC. It can also be used to target specific stakeholders to receive specific notifications but perhaps not all of them. This can be useful in high-volume alerting situations where there are many people with different specialties working within the SOC environment. So, you would set up alert notifications to be delivered in a specific manner based on the recipient’s roles and responsibilities. This also supports escalation<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> workflows when <span class="No-Break">called for.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Malcolm alerting can integrate with popular communication tools such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, and other incident response types of platforms. As with all of Malcolm’s tools, alerting and notifying can also be sent to Kibana or other visualization platforms to help users get a graphical representation of the data they’re <span class="No-Break">looking at.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’ve installed the mama and papa system in Malcolm (though we can’t say we’ve ever met a mama named Malcolm, but hey, there’s a first time for everything!), it’s time to drill down into some of the amazing tools contained within the suite. We’re going to start by reviewing a packet capturing and indexing utility called Arkime in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Arkime</h1>
<p>Arkime is a tool that falls into <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>the category of packet capturing and indexing. Like all the tools we’re covering from Kali Purple, it is free, open source software. Arkime is designed to efficiently work with very large-scale deployments. That, however, comes at the cost of resources, such as storage and RAM capacities. The bigger you want your deployment to be, the more resources you will need. Fortunately, the organization offers a resource calculator on their website to help you prepare. We’ll toss that link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for those of you with big aspirations who might be <span class="No-Break">reading this.</span></p>
<p>Like the ELK stack, Arkime has enough features and customizations that an entire book could be written on just this one product alone. For that reason, we will only highlight the features of this product. As a cybersecurity professional, you already know just from reading this book alone that independent research will always be a part of your lifestyle, just as it is for surgeons, lawyers, and all other levels of white-collar professions. Welcome to the club of well-researched and intellectually <span class="No-Break">elite folks.</span></p>
<p>The Arkime organization prides itself on a<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> style of packet capture called <strong class="bold">full packet capture</strong> (capturing every packet) versus <strong class="bold">filtered packet capture</strong> (only capturing packets that meet <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>predefined criteria). There are many brands of packet-capturing products out there. Arkime is free, open source software; this is something you might have realized is the theme of the Kali Purple distribution. Don’t kid yourself, though. Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s cheap. Arkime is a beast! It is very robust and operates just as powerfully – even more so – than any commercially <span class="No-Break">available product.</span></p>
<p>If you’ve been immersed in<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> this aspect of networking and/or network security before, you’ll already be familiar with Arkime under its former name, Moloch. The developers have done something a whole bunch of us probably wish more modern tech businesses would do with their product. They have provided their intended pronunciation of the word Arkime! According to their website, it is to be said Arkime (/ɑːrkɪˈmi/) or (R Kim Me). They mentioned that the name change was due to feedback suggesting folks could use the term Moloch in an undesirable manner. Arkime was chosen as the new identity after the mythical wizard Merlin’s owl Archimedes and a well-known mathematician from historical Greece who went by the <span class="No-Break">same name.</span></p>
<p>Before we talk about Arkime’s offerings, you probably want to grab a copy of the product for yourself. However, note that it’s not necessary in this chapter to have any of the software we are talking about up and running while you’re reading. The majority of this content is a high-level overview since each component of Kali Purple we are discussing here is robust enough to warrant its own autonomous publication. However, it still provides value to acquire and run if you like to immerse yourself in your projects while you completely lose track of the time until your wife threatens to leave you unless you acknowledge her existence. Wait, that might be the software <span class="No-Break">engineer’s manual…</span></p>
<p>Make peace with your spouse. Then, we can get started. It’s time to take off the training wheels here and give you some independent fun installing Arkime, should you choose to do so. Before you walk the traditional route, it might be worth your while to do an internet search or two to see which updates to Arkime might have occurred since this publication. You might also find alternative repositories. Just make sure you keep your eyes peeled for authentic repositories and the availability of file hashes if you’re going outside of the APT terminal method we use <span class="No-Break">inside Linux.</span></p>
<p>Otherwise, if you’re looking to harness your inner budding Linux guru, then you know <span class="No-Break">the drill:</span></p>

<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">As you continue to negotiate the Kali Purple tools outside of the ELK stack, it is of paramount importance that you retain a certain level of patience. Some of these tools are updated very frequently and with each update, the manner of acquiring, installing, and running has the potential to be changed – either by design or unintended consequence. This is where your analyst mindset comes in handy. While developing the content for this book, several items were updated by their creators mid-writing and in the course of doing so, the manner of acquiring and/or installing or otherwise configuring the applications was changed. It is for that reason that we have chosen to focus on using Docker for any <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>multi-application setups or applications with independently <span class="No-Break">developed dependencies.</span></p>

<p>Let’s look at the key features <span class="No-Break">of Arkime:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Packet capture and storage</strong>: Arkime captures network packets by using an NIC, as we touched on in the first section. It does this in what is known as <strong class="bold">promiscuous mode</strong>. That mode is <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>where packet capture applications will collect every bit of data that passes through the portion of the network it is assigned to monitor. This <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>means it may collect data that is not intended for the device to be the final destination. It may be passing through the device on its journey to another device in the network. Conversely, <strong class="bold">non-promiscuous mode</strong> only captures packets that are addressed to the MAC address of the specific device that is being monitored by the packet-capturing application. In this case, <span class="No-Break">that’s Arkime.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Real-time traffic analysis</strong>: As the name implies, real-time traffic analysis is where Arkime will capture the packets from the NIC and immediately send the data to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage. It does this in one fell swoop, as the activity occurs. Arkime’s design allows it to monitor live network sessions so that it can track the behavior of network connections and observe user behaviors as they occur. By employing this method, Arkime and the tools integrated with it can identify anomalous and potentially threatening data flow quickly so that analysts can respond and stop bad actors in <span class="No-Break">their tracks.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Scalability and performance</strong>: Scalability and performance are Arkime’s greatest advantage over similarly competing network monitoring software. The application is designed to support distributed architecture. That means it can take the packet capture, query and index it, and split it up to send to different interconnected nodes that include different physical computing devices to be processed in unison. As you might have guessed, this not only allows for the workload to be negotiated efficiently but also for fault tolerance and easily upgrading and <span class="No-Break">improving equipment.</span><p class="list-inset">Fault tolerance would be if a device or node were to go down, the programming is in place to direct the other nodes to pick up the slack while the down node is addressed by technicians. Sometimes, a node will need to be taken offline intentionally. This could be for standard maintenance, upgrading, or replacement. This also means additional nodes can be added on the fly without needing to stop or intervene with the active setup in any manner. The technicians simply add the new nodes and then adjust the rules of Arkime to also recognize and utilize the <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>added nodes in addition to the <span class="No-Break">pre-existing nodes.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Metadata generation and indexing</strong>: When Arkime captures packet data, it collects the entirety of the packet. That includes the payload, which is the data that was instructed by the sending device to be sent, and the header, which is additional information that’s added to the original dataset to assist network and routing devices in sending the payload to the proper location in the proper manner, as well as other important information about the total packet. Within these packets are pieces of data that stand out from the rest as they are critical to the successful transmission of data. These special standout pieces of data are called <strong class="bold">metadata</strong>. Examples of <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>metadata might include source and destination IP addresses, timestamps, the byte size of the payload or total packet, and a plethora of <span class="No-Break">other possibilities.</span><p class="list-inset">One of the primary forms of metadata that’s utilized includes <span class="No-Break">transport protocols:</span></p><ul><li><strong class="bold">Transport Control Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">TCP</strong>): This is<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> used for transporting data once a communication has been established between the sending and <span class="No-Break">receiving devices</span></li><li><strong class="bold">User Datagram Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">UDP</strong>): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>used for transporting data without first requiring <span class="No-Break">a connection</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTP</strong>): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>used to transport data between web servers and clients (that is, the <span class="No-Break">user’s browser)</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTPS</strong>): This is the same as HTTP except it uses encryption for <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>authentication and <span class="No-Break">transferring data</span></li><li><strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>): This is used to transfer entire file sets from a file server to the<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> <span class="No-Break">user’s device</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Arkime was generous enough to publicly post screenshots of their product that depict these different aspects of the product, giving us more time and space to talk about the product. A link leading to Arkime’s screenshots with explanations has been provided in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section if you would like to get a visual depiction of these items <span class="No-Break">in action.</span><p class="list-inset">Upon capturing these<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> packets and extracting the metadata, Arkime will also utilize the robust power of Elasticsearch to index, store, and retrieve the data. Arkime allows its administrators to define custom indexing and mapping for the metadata fields. This is important for enterprise installations of the tool because the data that’s being extracted and stored can be organized in a manner that is most useful to the organization’s specific needs. Arkime allows its data that has been indexed with Elasticsearch’s support to be easily searchable and retrieved from the <span class="No-Break">Arkime interface.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Search and query capabilities</strong>: Through Arkime’s user interface, users can perform granular searches – that is, detailed, specific searches – with surgical precision while being able to perform queries that pinpoint details within captured network traffic data. It’s a type of search that allows the user to target specific fields or attributes <span class="No-Break">within packets.</span><p class="list-inset">Arkime supports a broad array of <span class="No-Break">search styles:</span></p><ul><li>By logical and <span class="No-Break">mathematical operators</span></li><li>By <span class="No-Break">metadata fields</span></li><li>With full-text searching – entire words, phrases, <span class="No-Break">and patterns</span></li><li>By regular expressions and <span class="No-Break">complex patterns</span></li><li>Through saved search templates – these can be created by users for frequently <span class="No-Break">utilized searches</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">Arkime can integrate with visualization tools to present the information it gathers from any of these search methods in graphical formats such as timelines, histograms, and charts. Arkime also allows users to share search results with colleagues for team-based analysis. Users can export the search results so that they can be used with external systems <span class="No-Break">or records.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Packet reassembly and session reconstruction</strong>: Arkime has the amazing ability to reassemble packets and reconstruct sessions, which gives it strong capabilities that can be used to piece together and analyze network traffic data directly at the packet and session levels of data transfer. This ability is used during the initial packet capture process. The software identifies fragmented or segmented packets and intelligently examines them to piece them back together into the original<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> single packet so that a full and accurate analysis can be performed on the data that was captured. This allows analysts to view the full picture of any scenario, which also can help in root cause analysis for <span class="No-Break">any issues.</span><p class="list-inset">Taken to the next level, Arkime can also reconstruct sessions by analyzing packets and logically grouping them if they are related and part of the same flow of data. Doing this allows analysts to view the entire exchange of a session, providing a grander context of the scenario. Analysts can then take a more holistic approach to data analysis by viewing the entirety of a data exchange between the two endpoints involved in <span class="No-Break">the session.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Threat detection and analysis</strong>: Everything we’ve discussed thus far is part of Arkime’s threat detection and analysis plus more! The following are also part of this <span class="No-Break">key feature:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Metadata enrichment</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Rule-based detection</span></li><li>Protocol analysis and <span class="No-Break">anomaly detection</span></li><li>Integration with threat <span class="No-Break">intelligence feeds</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">Metadata enrichment is the same as typical data enrichment, where the data that’s harvested is compared with related tables of pre-existing data to help parse the information into clearer categories. Rule-based detection is just as it sounds. The administrator can create custom rules to look for precise threats, patterns of behavior, <span class="No-Break">and IoCs.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Protocol analysis and anomaly detection are the process of examining and interpreting the communication <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>protocols that are used in network traffic to evaluate uncommon, abnormal, or anomalous behavior. It involves dissecting the headers, structure, and payloads of the communication packets. Then, it takes that information and compares/contrasts it with the protocols that are used, such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and others. Administrators will look for communication pattern changes such as volume and handshake failures. Handshakes are part of the sending and receiving devices authenticating with each other and is the process of establishing a connection between <span class="No-Break">the two.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Integration with threat intelligence feeds is where Arkime subscribes to or otherwise draws information that has<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> already been assembled by a third <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>party such as <strong class="bold">AlienVault OTX</strong> (now known as <strong class="bold">LevelBlue Labs</strong>), <strong class="bold">FBI InfraGuard</strong>, <strong class="bold">Spamhaus</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Proofpoint</strong> and brings that information into its own <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>environment to help with analyzing data. This is a form <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>of data enrichment. Examples of third-party information<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> include reputable blacklists, known threat indicators such as cataloged malicious IP addresses, and other threat intelligence information. Subscribing to such feeds can significantly reduce the workload for any organization because you’re grabbing the results of work that has already been done by others and is <span class="No-Break">being shared.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Extensibility and integration</strong>: Similar to threat feed integration, Arkime allows extensibility of itself to allow for a wider range of integrations through capture plugins, protocol parsers, and decoders. Capture plugins are customized code modules that allow Arkime to grab network packet information from specialized or atypical sources. An example of this might be grabbing information from an <strong class="bold">industrial control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">ICS</strong>), a system that’s used in manufacturing and critical infrastructure such as <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>city water and sewer plants or nuclear power plants. These plugins <em class="italic">extend</em> the base practical use of Arkime, creating extensibility of the product itself. Extensibility can be further created by the capture plugins providing resources and support to decode and parse the data that it pulls from <span class="No-Break">non-standard sources.</span><p class="list-inset">Arkime also offers support for viewer plugins, which are plugins that extend the product’s ability to display the data through custom visualizations with user interface enhancements. That allows organizations to create displays that will only provide the data that is most relevant to their mission. This, in turn, helps create more efficient analysis and <span class="No-Break">detailed reports.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Protocol parsers operate<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> in the same capacity as capture and viewer plugins, whereby they extend the functionality of the product by offering customized features. In this case, it is code that’s meant to decode, parse, and analyze specialized and rarely seen protocols and then enrich the protocol data with previously <span class="No-Break">indexed metadata.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">User access control and permissions</strong>: Through its authentication and authorization mechanisms, Arkime can provide high-quality user access control and permissions management. Sure, Arkime will support the basic username/password authentication method. However, it also offers <strong class="bold">single sign-on</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSO</strong>) integration with<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> identity providers as well as authentication through <strong class="bold">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">LDAP</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>). By<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> offering these integrations, organizations with existing identity management infrastructure can authenticate their users who are trying to access the <span class="No-Break">Arkime platform.</span><p class="list-inset">Also included is RBAC. You experienced a small dose of what this is when you set up Filebeat in <a href="B21223_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>. It allows administrators to define roles with a pre-determined set of permissions and then assign users to this role afterward. This manner of user privileges allows a finer-tuned, granular, control over defining which users may have access to specific features, data, and other administrative abilities within <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Arkime also maintains very detailed audit trails of user activities. This serves the dual purpose of providing proper visibility into user actions and changes while also giving an avenue to preserve efforts administratively in the interest of creating audit trails to meet any <span class="No-Break">regulatory requirements.</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Rich data visualization</strong>: Arkime approached rich data visualization through a combination of customizable dashboards, graphical representations, and interactive visualizations. Like most dashboard-based platforms, users can customize their dashboards through the use of widgets. In this case, widgets can be used to emphasize real-time or historical data through topics such as traffic volume, protocol distribution, threat alerts, packet capture statistics, and top talkers. Users can aggregate <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>and display key metrics, trends, and analysis results. It can leverage graphical representation with charts, graphs, timelines, heatmaps, network traffic patterns, anomalies, communication relationships, and performance metrics to name a few. Interactive visualizations can happen when users explore and interact with the data dynamically, such as by zooming in/out, applying filters, panning across timeframes, and drilling down into more specific data elements if they wish to obtain a more detailed insight or gain a greater context of <span class="No-Break">a scenario.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>While Arkime is meant for overall traffic analysis, there is another tool that can be used to further refine such analysis when the traffic is encoded or obfuscated in some manner. That tool can also be accessed from the Malcolm GUI and it is known <span class="No-Break">as CyberChef.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>CyberChef and obfuscation</h1>
<p>You’ve seen a few references to American government contributions to the cybersecurity landscape. Now, let’s take a look at a British contribution. CyberChef is one of the most critical tools that every single <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>person working in a cybersecurity profession should have in their quick-access toolbox. It was created by the <strong class="bold">Government Communications Headquarters</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCHQ</strong>) of the United Kingdom. The organization is considered one of three<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> intelligence and security organizations responsible for providing <strong class="bold">Signals Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIGINT</strong>) and<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> information assurance to the UK government and armed forces. (The other two are MI5 and the famed MI6 from the James Bond and Mission Impossible pop culture – yes, the organizations <span class="No-Break">are real.)</span></p>
<p>GCHQ developed<a id="_idIndexMarker581"/> CyberChef to function as an open source web application for a variety of data processing, transformation, and analysis tasks. It was always intended to cater to the needs of cybersecurity professionals, digital forensics experts, and data analysts. It comes with a user-friendly interface and since it is released as open source, organizations can take it, adjust it, and integrate it within their tools. This is because having the tool online still leaves the data communication between its users and the product itself susceptible to interception, which is a security risk in itself. When used as a desktop tool or integrated into an organization’s SIEM solution, the data being worked with can be contained to where it is being utilized. One such solution is the Devo SIEM/SOAR solution, which is considered a next-gen cloud SIEM. Devo has a version of CyberChef embedded within its toolbox for authorized analysts and users within an organization to utilize so that the customer’s data never needs to be traversed outside of the cyber defenses that are collecting the data in the first place. Devo is not part of Kali Purple, but we’ve provided a link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section to satisfy your <span class="No-Break">curiosity anyway.</span></p>
<p>You’re probably sitting there wondering, “<em class="italic">Okay, so what’s all this hype about CyberChef?</em>” Let’s get into it. While using the tools we’ve covered in this chapter, an analyst will frequently encounter encrypted or obfuscated data. There may even be times when you might like to take data that is not encoded in either of those manners and add some form of encryption or encoding to it. All of this can be accomplished by CyberChef. CyberChef is a very powerful web application that can be integrated with other cybersecurity tools. As we just discussed, it can also be downloaded as a desktop utility or integrated into pre-existing tools. It specializes in raw data analysis to include encryption/decryption, encoding/decoding, and a sub-form of encoding known as obfuscation. It is designed to handle a great variety of data transformation tasks in a flexible yet user-friendly <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>manner. CyberChef has been designated as the <em class="italic">Cyber Swiss Army Knife</em> by its <span class="No-Break">creator, GCHQ.</span></p>
<p>To acquire CyberChef, you have a plethora of options. If you’re the cheating spoiler type, you can skip ahead to the end of this chapter, where you’ll find a quick link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section. That is the quickest way to get this application… that is unless you already have Malcolm installed and, along with your Kali Purple VM up and running. <em class="italic">&lt;&lt;insert evil laugh here&gt;&gt;</em> However, since we are working with Kali Purple, we will explain how to acquire CyberChef from within the <span class="No-Break">Purple environment.</span></p>
<p>It’s also pretty simple. First, make sure your VM with Kali Purple installed has been launched and is up and running. Then log in to your Purple instance, open a terminal window, and go through the intense sacrificial motions we’ve been brainwashing you with since <a href="B21223_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. We can summarize these <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Start your Kali Purple VM and log in to your <span class="No-Break">Purple instance.</span></li>
<li>Open a <span class="No-Break">terminal window.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">apt upgrade</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">./ start</strong> without <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">sudo</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">docker ps</strong> to verify that Malcolm is up and running, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.8</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></li>

<p>Go ahead and select and click that tile. It will load the CyberChef utility for you. In the top-left corner, you’ll notice that you can download this utility to your local device. Let’s put it to the test! Copy and paste the following code into the top-right window, known as the <strong class="bold">Input</strong> window, as identified in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.10</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

Two of the most common you’ll come across as a cyber defender are <strong class="bold">Base64</strong> and <strong class="bold">URL encoding</strong>. This code sample <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>we provided is <strong class="bold">Base64 encoding</strong>. Select the top tile in the left column labeled <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong>. When you do that, the section will expand and within it, you’ll see one called <strong class="bold">From Base64</strong>. Click and hold that one, drag it to the middle window labeled <strong class="bold">Recipe</strong>, and release your click for it to drop there, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.10</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>You’ll notice that there is also an option called <strong class="bold">To Base64</strong>. That’s right – CyberChef can be used to encode things in addition to decoding them. Go ahead and click through all of the areas within the left column and check out the expanded lists. You’ll see options to decode everything imaginable, including <strong class="bold">Morse Code</strong>! How cool <span class="No-Break">is that?</span></p>
<p>The one thing you will not see, however, is a <em class="italic">bad grammar decoder</em>. With that in mind, click the <strong class="bold">Bake</strong> button at the bottom of the middle column. If you already had the <strong class="bold">Auto Bake</strong> box checked, look at the results in the lower right window called <strong class="bold">Output </strong>window. Curious. What was the <strong class="bold">Base64 </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">decoded</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> message?</span></p>

<p>The key features of CyberChef are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Data transformation</strong>: CyberChef users can select and combine data manipulation options from the comprehensive list of built-in operations to create what it likes to call custom data transformation recipes. The list includes options that address encoding/decoding, compression, encryption/decryption, hashing, regular <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>expressions, and much more. Users can select options from the left column of CyberChef’s display and then drag and drop them into the middle window. CyberChef will process the instructions from the top down. So, it will perform the calculations from the first option you drag into the window first, use the next instruction you dropped, apply it to the results of the first calculation, and so on. This allows for batch processing. Users can save any repetitively used<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> tasks for easier <span class="No-Break">future reuse.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Encryption and decryption</strong>: With the cryptography aspect of CyberChef, you can work with both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, which will prove useful for those of you who might be responsible for working with securing data as one of your job/career roles. There are many built-in encryption operations you can access from the left column, including but not limited to AES, DES, RSA, Triple DES, Blowfish, and XOR. You can also utilize CyberChef to encode/decode hexadecimal, URL, and Base64 encoding among others. With all of these options, you might well guess that this tool can be used for key management and hashing operations (MD5, SHA-256, and many others). If cryptography is where you live, then you’ll be happy to know that you can use CyberChef to create customized encryption parameters such as key size, block size, padding modes, and <span class="No-Break">chaining modes.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">File processing</strong>: With CyberChef, you can read entire file inputs and you can output your results to an entire file. To grab a file as input, go to the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Input</strong> window and select the folder with an arrow pointing into it to grab a file as input, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em>. The supported file types include JSON, XML, binary, <span class="No-Break">and text:</span><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer109"><img alt="Figure 6.11 – CyberChef – getting a file as input" height="119" src="image/B21223_06_11.jpg" width="1050"/></div></li>
</ul>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11 – CyberChef – getting a file as input</p>
<p class="list-inset">You can also perform byte-level operations on binary files using bitwise logic. Additionally, CyberChef offers hexdump visualization for analyzing such binary data and file contents. Advanced CyberChef users can learn to parse and extract structured data from files using operations that have been tailored for specific file formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV, among others. They can also perform line-based processing, metadata extraction, and batch processing, as well as develop custom workflows to support their specific file <span class="No-Break">manipulation requirements.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Regular expressions</strong>: The CyberChef tool provides straightforward and dedicated operations for applying regular expressions to input data. The left-hand column, sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>referred to as the operations column in CyberChef, offers your regex operations. With it, users can define, configure, and apply regular expressions to their data inputs. You can specify a regex pattern to be used for searching and comparing against the input data if you like. Regex operations can be used to match patterns in this way and by doing that, it can also be used to transform and/or replace data, extract data that matches the regex, or it can be mixed with other operations such as encoding/decoding or other tasks defined by an analyst for quick pattern recognition and data extraction. CyberChef’s user-friendly interface helps add an element of visualization to the work, making the readability of the somewhat obscure regex patterns more <span class="No-Break">easily interpreted.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Networking and encoding</strong>: As it relates to the networking encoding aspect of information, in its operations column, CyberChef offers options for working with IP addresses, including the ability to convert between decimal and binary representations, extracting IP addresses from text, and also the ability to perform IP address manipulations such as subnetting and IP address validation. You’ll also see options for dissecting and analyzing network packet data, decoding packet headers and protocol-specific analysis, URL  / URI handling, and Base64 encoding and decoding, which is commonly found in networking information. If you followed our previous recommendations to explore the left column, you’ll see hexadecimal operations, encoding conversions such as URL encoding and HTML entity encoding, along with Unicode representation. Here’s a couple of fun operations for you. If you select the <strong class="bold">Data</strong> format sub-heading under operations, you’ll see you can convert to and from Braille; if you go just one subheading further down the list and select <strong class="bold">Encryption/Encoding</strong>, that’s where you’ll find the <strong class="bold">Morse Code</strong> conversation we spoke <span class="No-Break">of earlier.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Custom operations</strong>: Something very nice about every tool we’ve discussed in this chapter is how they each offer a plethora of opportunities for customization. CyberChef is no exception. You can develop custom operations through the use of <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>JavaScript code within the interface. That is one of the beautiful parts of this product’s extensibility. If you have a coding or software engineering background, you are likely already familiar with JavaScript; if you don’t, we’ve provided a link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> for your perusal. As a cybersecurity professional, it’s recommended that you upskill your Python first and foremost, but any additional programming language skills are always going to <span class="No-Break">be useful.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data analysis</strong>: The explanations that have been provided thus far have undoubtedly shown you how data analysis is a key feature of CyberChef. Please review any of the previous topics if you’re uncertain of CyberChef’s contributions to any of the following data <span class="No-Break">analysis features:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Data transformation</span></li><li>Encryption <span class="No-Break">and decryption</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Regular expressions</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">File processing</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Networking operations</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Customized options</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Virtualization</span></li><li>Integration with <span class="No-Break">other tools</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you’re dealing with traffic analysis – which is what the defensive aspect of cybersecurity is entirely about – you’re going to encounter attempts to evade defenses through trickery such as encoding and encrypting data. That makes CyberChef one of the most critical tools in your entire defensive toolset. We promised you a quick and easy manner of accessing CyberChef outside of Kali Purple and outside of Malcolm. Are you ready? Drum roll, please… Simply paste the following URL into any web browser and use it directly from the source: <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/</a>. The downside is that there are things such as data privacy and data privacy laws that will make using CyberChef remotely a risky option because whatever becomes decoded could be highly protected data. It’s best and safest to download a local copy or use it integrated with your toolset, as we did inside <span class="No-Break">of Malcolm.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we provided a high-level overview of the traffic that will be running through our network and therefore our cyber defense solution. We examined several tools provided by Kali Purple that we can deploy and integrate with other tools to analyze this data, as well as manipulate it if necessary. These solutions are well known and some of them, such as Arkime, are created by private sector organizations, whereas others were created and/or assembled by government organizations. Even more fun, some government organizations will include the private sector creations within their compilations, such as Malcolm <span class="No-Break">and Arkime.</span></p>
<p>We’ve learned that Arkime is a robust network data analysis tool that is designed for large organizations and organizations that are expected to experience quick and large growth. Arkime’s greatest strength is scalability. We also explored a suite of tools that was put together as a collaborative effort between American government agencies from the State of Idaho and federally from the Department of <span class="No-Break">Homeland Security.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we covered the world-famous CyberChef, which is a must-have for any cybersecurity professional. We learned that it was created and released by the British intelligence agency GCHQ. We explored the power of CyberChef as it relates to data manipulation and various elements of cryptography. We also learned that it can be used online, downloaded as a desktop product, or integrated into our independent <span class="No-Break">software solutions.</span></p>
<p>Before delving into all of these tools, we briefly explored data packets so that we could understand how most of these tools integrate with tools that work on a data packet level. In the course of doing so, we learned about IPS and DPS, both of which we will explore in more depth in <a href="B21223_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
