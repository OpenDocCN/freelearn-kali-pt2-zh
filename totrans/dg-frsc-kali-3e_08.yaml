    There’s a lot of research, processes, and analytics that also go into the case
    itself. Consider a scenario where you need to build a house. Sure, we need wood,
    nails, cement, metal, glass, and all other raw materials, but we also require
    skilled laborers and contractors to construct the structure and piece it together.
    Apart from the materials, tools, and resources, we will have also done our research
    to ensure that we understand what is needed for this to be a successful project.

    consider the weather, and then choose to specify types of materials based on the
    weather, location, soil type, and so on. It goes without saying that there must
    be an understanding of fundamental concepts in the field to efficiently carry
    out the task. In the same way, we need to understand the file systems, **operating
    systems** (**OSs**), data types, and locations, as well as a thorough understanding
    of methods and procedures for preserving data, storage media, and general evidence.

    devices, data must be stored somewhere, even if it’s just temporarily. Most of
    us may be familiar with **hard disk drives** (**HDDs**) within laptops, desktops,
    mobile devices, and so on, but we also need to focus on removable and portable
    storage devices regardless of age, as they may still be used. These include DVDs,

    of the 305 **Random Access Method of Accounting and Control** (**RAMAC**), which
    utilized the first disk storage technology. This revolutionary technology weighed
    in at approximately one ton and was roughly 16 square feet in size. The disk space
    capacity of this behemoth; however, was only 5 MB (megabytes, yes, I said megabytes)
    in size.

    that could amount to as many as millions of cards just to hold a few megabytes.

    released as the IBM 5100 Portable Computer. In the 1980s, specifically 1981, we
    saw the birth of the IBM Personal Computer. Weighing in at much less than its

    owners were afforded a keyboard and mouse, with options for a monitor, printer,
    and floppy drives. Apart from the floppy drives, this was the standard for today’s

    way to store data at a speed equal to its processing time. The IBM 726 magnetic
    tape reader and recorder was one of the first devices to offer this storage, with
    a capacity or tape density of 100 bits per linear inch of tape. An inch of tape
    should give an indicator of the size of the tape, which was wound on a large wheel,
    similar to an old film roll movie tape.

    plastic strip in frames separated by gaps consisting of blocks. Magnetic tape
    is still very much used today, and like many other storage media types, it has
    significantly decreased in size while increasing capacity and speed.

    developed newer tape storage media with a tape density of 200 **gigabits per second**
    (**Gps**) per inch on a single cartridge, which can record up to 333 **gigabytes**
    (**GB**) of data. These cartridges (for older folks like myself) are the size
    of a cassette tape or (for the younger ones) not much smaller than the average

    floppy disk drive in 1971\. Although mainframe computers back then already had
    hard drives and magnetic tape storage media, there was the need for a simple and
    cheaper means of saving and passing on software and instructions to the mainframes,
    previously done using the much slower punch cards.

    charges. You may have perhaps heard someone say that they’ve had to flash their
    mobile device. This is quite similar to erasing flash storage media on smartphones
    and smart devices, except devices with OSs such as Android and iOS require a much
    more extensive procedure for flashing and reinstalling their OSs. However, the
    end result is very much the same in that the memory and storage areas are reset

    flash memory, and are responsible for high-speed and high-capacity storage of
    data on flash storage media. They are newer types of **electrically erasable programmable
    read-only memory** (**EEPROM**) chips that can wipe blocks of data or the entire
    drive, rather than just one byte at a time, as with the slower EEPROM. This type
    of flash memory chip is non-volatile, meaning that the data is still stored on
    the chip even after power to the chip is lost. Data is erased when specific instructions
    are sent to the chip in the form of electrical signals via a method known as in-circuit
    writing, which alters the data accordingly.

    an average read-write usage, sometimes displayed on the packaging of the device.
    The read-write speeds are also some of the fastest at this point, which is why

    speeds of 150/300/600 Mbps. This meant that the lowest SATA transmission speed

    an SSD, much like a flash drive or memory card, can be lost or wiped within minutes
    or even seconds. Although traditional tools can be used to image and recover data
    from SSDs, I strongly suggest researching any SSD drive before performing any
    forensic activities to get a better understanding of its workings and complexities,
    such as de-chipping and wear-leveling algorithms. De-chipping is a method of reading
    data from memory chips and wear-leveling involves techniques used to preserve

    factors, let’s look at the importance of RAM and learn about the uses of the paging
    file and RAM cache in the next section.

- en: OSs can use a portion of the hard disk as an extension of RAM. This is referred
    to as virtual memory and is usually a good idea if a computer or laptop has limited
    RAM. Although the hard drive is much slower than the RAM, the swap file or paging
    file on the disk can store files and programs that are being accessed less, leaving
    the RAM available to store data that is frequently accessed. This process involves
    the OS swapping pages of data less frequently used and moving data to the dedicated
    paging file area on the hard drive.

    not as volatile as RAM itself due to being stored on the hard disk, it is a hidden
    file in Windows called **pagefile.sys**, and should always be inspected using
    tools of your choice, as this file may reveal passwords for encrypted areas, information
    from sites visited, documents opened, logged-in users, printed items, and so on.

    of the paging or swap file is that the data can be stored in a contiguous manner,
    one piece after the next, allowing for faster access times.

- en: It is recommended that the size of the paging file is set to 1.5 times the amount
    of memory and be stored on a separate drive if possible, not just a separate partition.

    and analysis of the paging file in any DFIR investigation is crucial. Feel free
    to review the chapter and make notes on all the terms covered before proceeding
    to the next chapter.

- en: In this chapter, we took the time to cover some of the basics of non-volatile
    storage media, which stores data even after there is no power supplied to the
    medium. Non-volatile media includes different types of HDDs, such as mechanical
    and solid-state PATA and SATA drives, flash drives, and memory cards.

- en: Newer storage media devices, including SSDs, use a special type of flash memory
    called NAND flash to store data. This flash memory is far faster and more durable
    than traditional mechanical drives, as the devices contain no moving parts; however,
    they are still quite costly for now.

- en: We also looked at various file systems associated with various OSs and saw that
    the smallest allocation of data is called a cluster, which can reside in slack
    space. Slack space is unused space within a cluster in which data can be hidden.
    Data itself has different states and can be at rest, in motion, or in use. Regardless
    of the state of the data, there always resides some information about the data
    itself, called metadata.

- en: Any data accessed by the user or OS is temporarily stored in volatile memory
    or RAM. Although data can be stored for lengthy periods on non-volatile memory,
    it is lost when electrical charges to volatile memory (RAM) are also lost. An
    area of the hard disk called the paging file can act as virtual RAM, allowing
    the computer to think it has more RAM than actually installed.
