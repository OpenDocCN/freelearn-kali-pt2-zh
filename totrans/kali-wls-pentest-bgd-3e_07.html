<span class="emphasis"><em>As a penetration tester, it is important to know the advanced attacks a hacker can do, even if you might not check or demonstrate them during a penetration test.

</p><p>In this chapter, we will take a look at how we can conduct advanced attacks using what we have learned so far. We will primarily focus on the <span class="strong"><strong>Man-in-the-Middle</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MITM</strong></span>) attack, which requires a certain amount of skill and practice to conduct successfully. Once we have <a class="indexterm" id="id223"/>done this, we will use this MITM attack as a base from which to conduct more sophisticated attacks such as eavesdropping and session hijacking.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">MITM attack</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wireless eavesdropping using MITM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Session hijacking using MITM</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="A Man-in-the-Middle attack"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec72"/>A Man-in-the-Middle attack</h1></div></div></div><p>MITM attacks are probably one of the most potent attacks on a WLAN system. There are different configurations <a class="indexterm" id="id224"/>that can be used to conduct the attack. We will use the most common one—the attacker is connected to the internet using a wired LAN and is creating a fake access point on his client card. This access point broadcasts an SSID similar to a local hotspot in the vicinity. A user may accidently get connected to this fake access point (or can be forced to via the higher signal strength theory we discussed in the previous chapters) and may continue to believe that he is connected to the legitimate access point.</p><p>The attacker can now <a class="indexterm" id="id225"/>transparently forward all the user's traffic over the internet using the bridge he has created between the wired and wireless interfaces.</p><p>In the following lab exercise, we will simulate this attack.</p></div></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>We <a class="indexterm" id="id231"/>successfully created the setup for a wireless MITM attack. We did this by creating a fake access point and bridging it with our Ethernet interface. This ensured that any wireless client connecting to the fake access point will perceive that it is connected to the internet via the wired LAN.</p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – MITM over pure wireless"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec68"/>Have a go hero – MITM over pure wireless</h2></div></div></div><p>In the <a class="indexterm" id="id232"/>previous exercise, we bridged the wireless interface with a wired one. As we noted earlier, this is one of the possible connection architectures for an MITM. There are other combinations possible as well. An interesting one would be to have two wireless interfaces, one that creates the fake access point and the other interface that is connected to the authorized access point. Both these interfaces are bridged. So, when a wireless client connects to our fake access point, it gets connected to the authorized access point through the attacker's machine.</p><p>Please note that this configuration would require the use of two wireless cards on the attacker's laptop.</p><p>Check whether you can conduct this attack using the in-built card on your laptop along with the external one—bear in mind, you may not have the injection drives required for this activity. This should be a good challenge!</p></div></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="id239"/>MITM setup we created now allows us to eavesdrop on the victim's wireless traffic without the victim knowing. This is possible because, in an MITM, all the traffic is relayed via the attacker's machine. Thus, all of the victim's unencrypted traffic is available for eavesdropping for the attacker.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Session hijacking over wireless"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec76"/>Session hijacking over wireless</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the <a class="indexterm" id="id240"/>other interesting attacks we can build on top of MITM is application session hijacking. During an MITM attack, the victim's packets are sent to the attacker. It is now the attacker's responsibility to relay this to the legitimate destination and relay the responses from the destination to the victim. An interesting thing to note is that, during this process, the attacker can modify the data in the packets (if unencrypted and unprotected from tampering). This means he can modify, mangle, and even silently drop packets.</p><p>In <a class="indexterm" id="id241"/>this next example, we will take a look at DNS hijacking over wireless using the MITM setup. Then, using DNS hijacking, we will hijack the browser session to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>.</p></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>We <a class="indexterm" id="id247"/>did an application hijacking attack using a wireless MITM as the base. So, what happened behind the scenes? The MITM setup ensured that we were able to see all the packets sent by the victim. As soon as we saw a DNS request packet coming from the victim, the <code class="literal">dnsspoof</code> program running on the attacker's laptop sent a DNS response to the victim with the attacker machine's IP address that of <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>.
