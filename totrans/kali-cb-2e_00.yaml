- en: Kali Linux, the most popular security testing platform available today, provides
    a means for individuals from all walks of life to become more experienced with
    penetration testing and information security. Kali is not only the cornerstone
    of many security penetration testing programs, but also has a tremendous community
    of users who share code, methods, and experiences to help even the most seasoned
    security practitioners become more effective. As a platform, Kali Linux is quite
    versatile. It can be run from bootable media, installed onto hardware platforms,
    or run in virtual environments. It can be enhanced with any number of tools available
    outside of the native distribution (and we will demonstrate this in the following
    chapters). It truly gives you the means to have a single platform to work from,
    in any format you like, without the need for expensive investments in hardware
    and software.

    and network security, being able to understand how the attacker operates allows
    you to become more effective at providing balanced and appropriate controls.

    such as Nexpose, Nessus, and OpenVAS to perform various types of penetration testing
    tasks. We will cover how to set up an effective lab for testing purposes and we
    will also cover many aspects of penetration testing, along with useful advice
    on how to go about being successful in using the Kali Linux platform.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes a medium level of expertise on Linux operating systems, strong
    knowledge of networking technologies, including both wired and wireless, moderate
    experience with OS platform configuration, and moderate experience with general
    information security concepts. This book will go through the process of setting
    up a basic testing lab, the installation of Kali Linux, and the tools needed to
    perform network reconnaissance, and exploitation. Because you will be running
    exercises against live hosts, it is important that this environment is isolated
    from other non-test environments.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make best use of the content of this book, knowledge in networking, device
    management, general information security concepts, and core operating systems
    is required. Foundational knowledge of Kali Linux is also expected. Since Kali
    Linux provides a tremendous number of tools for many different purposes, it is
    impossible to cover all possible combinations of the available tools and their
    use. For more details on all the tools available within Kali Linux, visit the
    official Kali Linux Tool page located at [https://tools.kali.org/](https://tools.kali.org/).
    With that in mind, this book is intended to provide a more in-depth set of recipes
    to take advantage of these tools to sharpen your knowledge of security penetration
    testing and exploitation of insecure/undersecured environments.
