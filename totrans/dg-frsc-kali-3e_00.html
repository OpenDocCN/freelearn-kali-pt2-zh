<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>In this third edition of this book, you’ll find that the theory and methodologies have remained mostly the same with updates on general technical information, best practices, and frameworks, as the procedures and documentation are standard throughout the field; however, you’ll find that the technical chapters contain new labs using new examples. I’ve also included a few completely new chapters that go deeper into artifact analysis, automated data recovery, malware, and network analysis, showcasing several tools with practical exercises that even beginners will find easy to follow. We even utilize Wine, which will allow us to install very popular (<strong class="bold">Digital Forensics and Incident Response</strong>) (<strong class="bold">DFIR</strong>) tools built for the Windows platform (such as Autopsy 4) within Kali Linux. This book is quite useful for Red Teamers and penetration testers who wish to learn about or enhance their DFIR and Blue Teaming skillsets to become Purple Teamers by combining their penetration testing skills with the digital forensics and incident response skills that will be taught throughout <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>The third edition of this book was carefully structured to be easily understood by individuals at all levels, from beginners and digital forensics novices to incident response professionals alike, as the first six chapters serve to get you acquainted with the technologies used and also guide you through setting up Kali Linux, before delving into forensic analysis, data recovery, malware analysis, automated DFIR analysis, and network forensics investigations. Red teamers and penetration testers wanting to learn Blue Teaming skillsets to become Purple Teamers may also find the contents of this book <span class="No-Break">very useful.</span></p>
