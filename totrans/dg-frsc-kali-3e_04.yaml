    you may already be familiar with the installation process and perhaps even some
    of the advanced features, such as partitioning and networking. For beginners and
    those of you who are new to Kali Linux, we encourage you to pay particular attention
    to this chapter as we begin from the absolute basics of downloading Kali Linux,
    working our way up to a successful installation.

    previously as BackTrack, with releases from versions one to five, Kali Linux was
    first seen in 2015 and released as Kali 1.0\. From 2016 onward, Kali was then
    named according to the year. So, for instance, at the time of writing this book,
    the version used is Kali 2022.3, released in August 2022.

    later date when new versions of Kali Linux, such as 2023 and later, may be available,
    you can easily update your instance of Kali Linux by using the **sudo apt-get
    update** command, demonstrated later in the *Updating* *Kali* section.

    from the website of its creators, **Offensive Security**. The main reason for
    this is that the downloads of Kali on other pages could possibly be fake or, worse,
    infected with malware, such as Trojans, rootkits, and even ransomware. Offensive
    Security has also included hashes of all versions of Kali downloads on their site,
    allowing users to compare the hash of their downloaded version of Kali with what
    was generated and posted by Offensive Security on their website ([https://www.kali.org](https://www.kali.org)).

    installer images, including Kali Everything, can all be installed on virtual platforms
    and run no differently than they would on physical machines. The advantage of
    using Kali Linux as a VM is that you do not have to purchase any new or additional
    hardware. You can also delete and reinstall the VMs very easily and even create
    a snapshot of the OS once you’ve configured exactly as you would like it, which
    you can boot into at any time if you’ve broken your Kali machine and need to revert
