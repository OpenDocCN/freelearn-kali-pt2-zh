    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is about the use of Kali Linux in performing penetration tests against networks, systems, and applications. A penetration test simulates an attack against a network or a system by a malicious outsider or insider. Unlike a vulnerability assessment, penetration testing is designed to include the exploitation phase. Therefore, it proves that the exploit is present and that the system is at risk of being compromised if not acted upon.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Throughout this book, we will refer to <em class="italic">penetration testers</em>, <em class="italic">attackers</em>, <em class="italic">pentesters</em>, and <em class="italic">hackers</em> interchangeably as they use the same techniques and tools to assess the security of networks and data systems. The only difference between them is their end objective—infiltrating a secure data network or a data breach. </p>
      <p class="normal">Readers must be aware that it is <strong class="keyWord">illegal</strong> to knowingly/intentionally scan or access a protected computer or network without explicit approval. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In short, this book will take you through a journey of a penetration tester with many proven techniques to defeat the latest defenses on a network using Kali Linux. From selecting the most effective tools, to rapidly compromising network security to highlighting the techniques used to avoid detection.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">If you’re a penetration tester, IT professional, or security consultant who wants to maximize the success of your network testing using some of the advanced features of Kali Linux, then this book is for you. Some prior exposure to the basics of penetration testing/ethical hacking would be helpful to get the most out of this title.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Goal-Based Penetration Testing</em>, introduces a functional outline based on the penetration testing methodology that will be used throughout the book. It ensures that a coherent and comprehensive approach to penetration testing will be followed. </p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Open-Source Intelligence and Passive Reconnaissance</em>, provides a background on how to gather information about a target using publicly available sources and the tools that can simplify reconnaissance and information management.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Active Reconnaissance of External and Internal Networks</em>, introduces the reader to stealthy approaches that can be used to gain information about the target, especially the information that identifies vulnerabilities, which could be exploited.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Vulnerability Assessment</em>, teaches you the semi-automated process of scanning a network and its devices to locate systems that are vulnerable to attack and compromise and the process of taking all reconnaissance and vulnerability scan information, assessing it, and then creating a map to guide the penetration testing process.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Advanced Social Engineering and Physical Security</em>, shows you why being able to physically access a system or interact with the humans who manage it provides the most successful route to exploitation.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Wireless and Bluetooth Attacks</em>, provides a brief explanation of wireless and Bluetooth technologies and focuses on the common techniques used to compromise these networks by bypassing security.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Exploiting Web-Based Applications</em>, provides a brief overview of one of the most complex delivery phases to secure: web-based applications that are exposed to the public internet.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Cloud Security Exploitation</em>, focuses on attacks against AWS cloud infrastructure, which are frequently prone to security misconfigurations and are protected to the same degree as the organization’s primary network.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Bypassing Security Controls</em>, demonstrates the most common security controls in place, identifies a systematic process for overcoming these controls, and demonstrates this using the tools from the Kali toolset.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Exploitation</em>, demonstrates the methodologies that can be used to find and execute exploits that allow a system to be compromised by an attacker.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Action on the Objective and Lateral Movement</em>, focuses on the immediate post-exploit activities, as well as the aspect of horizontal escalation – the process of using an exploited system as a starting point to “jump off” to other systems on the network.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Privilege Escalations</em>, teaches the penetration tester to own all aspects of a system’s operations; more importantly, obtaining some access privileges that allow the tester to control all the systems across a network. </p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Command and Control</em>, focuses on what a modern attacker would do to enable data to be exfiltrated to the attacker’s location and hide the evidence of the attack.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Embedded Devices and RFID hacking,</em> focuses on what a modern attacker would do to perform a structured attack on embedded devices and clone NFC cards.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="heading-1">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <p class="normal">To practice the material presented in this book, you will need virtualization tools such as VMware or VirtualBox.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will need to download and configure the Kali Linux operating system and its suite of tools. To ensure that it is up-to-date and that you have all of the tools, you will need access to an internet connection.</p>
    <p class="normal">Sadly, not all of the tools on the Kali Linux system will be addressed since there are too many of them. The focus of this book is not to overwhelm you with all of the tools and options but to provide an approach for testing that will allow you to learn and incorporate new tools as their experiences and knowledge change over time.</p>
    <p class="normal">Although most of the examples from this book focus on Microsoft Windows, the methodology and most of the tools are transferrable to other operating systems such as Linux and the other flavors of Unix.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, this book applies Kali to complete the cyber kill chain against target systems. You will need a target operating system. Many of the examples in the book use Microsoft Windows 2016, Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.04, and Windows 2008 R2. </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">To make the best use of lab exercises, it is recommended that you disable Windows Defender on the vulnerable Windows servers by running PowerShell with administrative privilege and typing <code class="inlineCode">Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true</code></p>
